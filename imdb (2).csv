Review
Ufotable is honestly on a roll with the hit Demon Slayer series. It's simply bloody fantastic but also has a lot of heart, as a lot of people will see in this movie, which introduces one of the other Hashiras of the Demon Slayer Corps.
Set Your Heart Ablaze..... Rengoku-sanAh finally back at the theater. It sure felt good. This is the Mugen train arc that was set up at the end of season 1 of Demon Slayer.I expected the same level of animation in the anime, and this movie delivered that aspect the best way it could. It was pleasure for my eyes to see the flame, water, and thunder breathing techniques on display. The action scenes were breathtaking and intense.My problem was that the plot was pretty simple, which made the movie felt too short. I wanted to learn more about the characters, especially Rengoku, and even the demons. The emotion did not hit as high as it could.Overall, the movie was still a blast. 8.5/10.
Nearly Perfect
If you liked the animation of the season 1 of demon slayer you will simply adore this film this is a true masterpiece with a captivating story and music that will make you cry , a must watch for any fan of the show .
10 is not enough, from Japan
Rengoku is awesome in this film, and you understand why everyone looks up to him.I just have to state the most obvious thing though, this animation is truly breathtaking, if you love the show you're going to love this movie.To be honest I just had a great time watching it, me and my friends all loved it, not to mention the fight scenes are impeccable.Definitely an A+
I read the manga so I knew what would happen but seeing it animated just brought another level of heartbreak to me. With the amazing animation and background music, I was engrossed in this movie. Also, the final fight scene between Rengoku and the Upper Rank Three demon was probably one of the best fight scenes I've watched so far. Granted, I haven't watched many fight scenes. Still, it was such a pleasure to watch.
If you have watched the first season of Demon Slayer. You will not be disappointed. If you only read manga, you will also not be disappointed. Feelz are real. Visuals 10, feelz 10, sound track 10, humour 10 and story line 10. So don't read other reviews to decide if you should watch it or not. Go and Watch it.
I was worried because the movie is in the train, and I was afraid it will become boring. After I finished the movie, i realize that I shouldn't worried about this thing from the start. Every scene in this movie is really well planed, if the action scene start getting too long they will change it into another scene so we will not get bored with the action (I mean the composition of action and te conversation is balance.)And then the effects, both 3D and 2D. It's P E R F E C T. Even though we only have 2 hours to know Rengoku character, but the feeling, the emotion still really hit me. Like I cry a river in the cinemaðŸ˜¬It's really recommended! But please remind this in your mind that you need to watch the season 1 before you watch this movie.
"Had no idea what I was walking into, that's as frank as I can make it. Out of nowhere my kid has a love for Demon Slayer and here I am along for the ride. But she's seen the show and I had no context. Here we have a bunch of people on a train, one of them really excited about his bento box (""Umai! ... Umai!""), another wearing a boar's head, now everyone's asleep and pretty soon the fighting begins . . .That said . . .It is a gorgeous film. The battle scenes are exciting, the animation is superb, and the high quality bears out (Tanjiro's water effects are crazy).Purely on a visual level, I enjoyed this film. I have no doubt that any self-respecting anime fan is scoffing at my ignorance, but it is what it is. Mugen Train is easy on the eyes."
An amazing thrill ride full of comedy, dark and emotional moments that will leave you begging for more. If you liked the Demon Slayer anime, you are sure to love this movie.
I wont say the best but its really good, full of every anime recipe. This is my first time watching anime movie in cinema its worth it. Feel like gonna watch again!
"Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is a movie that was looked forward to universally with as much hype as possible. And when it eventually did come out, the reviews were great and so was its box office performance. And ever since, this movie has been a pretty big deal amongst the anime community.I finally was able to watch it, and I guess I'm a little underwhelmed by the whole thing. My reaction to this movie was very similar to how I felt about the series, and I think the same can be said of everyone. The series, in my opinion, is a decently enjoyable B-Tier anime with 1 exceptionally phenomenal episode. But that's just my take on it and I'm aware I'm in the minority here, because the amount of love this series has garnered is almost unbelievably massive and universal. So what Mugen Train caters to is exactly that demographic of fans (as so it should), meaning that for someone like me who found very little to go crazy about in the series, would find very little to go crazy about in this movie. But if you're one of those who loved the series for its goofiness and style, then this movie is in every way a treat.I don't think Mugen Train was a bad movie in any way. It was decently enjoyable and had its little moments. The plot is pretty straight forward but makes very little sense if you even stop to think about it. The progress was lazily convenient and the stakes never felt real until at the very end of the movie. The humor was pretty goofy and the characters were as over-the-top as they were in the series... Enjoyable, still The animation was pretty good and consistent throughout; especially the action scenes that were choreographed as well as they were in the series. The colors, the visuals, the music... they're all pretty great and add to the visually pleasing appeal of the movie.In conclusion, this movie doesn't add anything to the medium in any meaningful way, but it stays true to its style and convention as that is what people love most about the Demon Slayer universe. If you loved the series, you'll love this movie... Go for it!"
This movie takes of where season one of the series stops and it is just that, 2 episodes stitched together. So if you didn't see the series, you need at least watch a recap before watching this. Although I've seen a lot of anime movies and I know Japanese animation has a different approach than western animation, I was very underwhelmed by this one and not moved at all.Only watch this movie when you love the series.
Unbelievable out of the box
Yeah the succes of this movie is no secret by this point! It started a trend where other studios also made movies that tied into the shows, such as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, One piece Red and the upcoming Haikyuu final part 1 and 2!The movie is guarenteed to blow you away og shock you in one way or another! The story is simple, but effective! It never feels like it slows down, and the almost 2hr runtime will go by fast! By the time the movie ends you will have cried your eyes out! So many emotions in this movie! The animation is also INCREDIBLE!! UNREAL AT TIMES!! Set the bar for the amazing fights in season 2! The characters are also likeable and all get their moment to shine! Soundtrack is also incredible, especially Akaza and Rengoku theme!Overall a fun and emotional train-ride i would highly recommend!
Having seen the anime I loved this movie. Outstanding animation and likable characters (tanjiro, zenitsu, inosuke).(Saw in japanese with english subtitles)Really funny and emotionally investing scenes with awesome looking fight scenes.
Just wow!!!
A true delight for the demon slayer fans, starts slow but picks up the pace brilliantly after the interval.
Worth watching in the cinemas! The animation and the story arc is excellent!
"I'm so sorry everyone...but I didn't like it; that's a shame 'cuz the Anime is actually pretty good (8/10). My huge apologies."
First half of the film was pretty cheesy, slow and I found uninteresting compared to how amazing the show really is.The last 20-30 minutes of this movie really was the anchor as it was a spectacular fight scene with incredible animation that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Made it worth the watch and hopefully they figure it out in the next film where the the whole story will be interesting to watch.
Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train (2020) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on Hulu. A serial killer demon(s) has made the news as they target victims on trains. Flame Pillar, Kyojuro Rengoku,is looking to destroy the demon. He is aided by our heroes from the Demon Slayer series.This movie is directed by Haruo Sotozaki (Cowboy Beebop: The Movie) and contains the voices of Hiro Shimono (Attack on Titan), Natsuki Hanae (Dragon Ball Z), Satoshi Hino (Naruto) and Katsuyuki Konishi (Pokemon: The Movie).The animation in this is outstanding, especially the attack scenes. I adored the depiction of the demons and the weapons attacks and enhancements were great. The villains were good and creative and there's several scenes in doubt for our heroes. The final fight is unbelievably good.Overall this was a well done movie that did the series proud. I would strongly recommend this and score it a 8.5/10.
Good. But the hype is totally meaningless. One of the most overrated animated movies the world has ever seen on planet earth.
Nice animations, but very corny and clichŽ
There isn't enough ink or paper in the world to write down everything i loved about this visual spectacle, not that my words could even scratch the surface of fully captivating this level of quality. So I'll just say the things that stopped this masterful work from being a 10/10. There is an large amount of blatant exposition is this film, there are times when it makes sense for a character to be revealing such information but Enmu just stood on top of the train telling his entire plan and more for over 10 minutes for no reason. The music is still top notch but I don't think it was nearly as powerful as the score in the 1st season which stuck to more traditional Japanese instruments. Stop reading this already and go watch it!!!
Truely a masterpiece
This movie strikes other anime movies like a Mugen Train
Set Your Heart Ablaze
This is the best anime movie ever atleast for now, but i ain't cappin abt this u must watch 100%!
I'm out of words to describe it after watching. The overall story, animation and fight scenes are amazing. The red flames if Rengoku San are so amazing, I've never seen this type of animation in other anime so far. It's wonderful.I would like to thank the original manga creator Koyoharu Gotouge for giving us this master piece.Demon slayer was my 2nd anime and I loved it so much as a normie. It made me teary at some at some point and the movie gives you same vibes. I already knew the ending still it made the heart melt. :(
As a movie that starts after the events of the anime I expected more, because you don't need to identify the characters or build them, You have a lot of time And the movie didn't use this time properly, It could better by showing up more characters and deeper villainess.I loved the drama in this movie and touched me at some points.But at some point the comedy in this movie wasn't at the right time and exaggerating, and I fell they trying to say whether you like it or not you should laugh.Production wasn't the best they used cgi wasn't very bad, but it's cgi anyway, actually the animation In episode 19 of the anime was better.
Truely a masterpiece
This movie strikes other anime movies like a Mugen Train
Set Your Heart Ablaze
I cannot stress enough with how amazing this film was. I watched 90% of the film with a blurred vision because of how emotional it made me feel. I cannot even pick a favourite scene or moment because of how well delivered each moment was.
They got me in the first half I won't lie.I came in expecting a particular story, got that exact story and then the movie kicked off into the most marvelous ending I have ever seen in an anime movie.It is correctly mature. It moves you emotionally. It's gorgeous to look at and honestly deserves an 11/10 rating easily.
This movie is a masterpiece, the story is on point, the characters are amazingly awesome and very well animated. This movie might not be one of the greatest animes or movies of all time...but its definitely the best film of 2021 so far....a movie that focuses on story instead of politics is a movie that should be supported and watched by everyone and this movie is surely part of that rank. Great movie, awesome movie and deserves a 10, definitely deserves to be in the top 250 films of all time in imdb also.
"I'm an anime-nerd having watched anime for 20 years plus.This movie is hands-down the best piece of anime I have ever seen.I had big expectations being a big Kimetsu no Yaiba fan to begin with. For anyone serious about anime, it's mandatory to watch the first season before touching this movie.The first part of the movie was a great appetizer, but the second part beginning with Akaza's arrival is to me the best piece of cinema I ever watched.It's great Shounen at it's core - so great that it transgresses the genre. It's touching - for anyone - exactly because the story, especially Rengoku's story is so relatable.Everyone goes through hardships in their life. This movie manages to touch these difficult deeply psychological subjects in such a serious and consequential, yet playful way through multiple lenses/characters.It encapsulates a way to look at life; struggles are inevitable, it is about how you overcome them. On that note, all that is left to say;""Set your heart ablaze and go beyond your limits."""
Wait until universally released, This gon' make a noise that can't be unheard
"Amazing! It continues nearly right off after the last episode in season 1 and the length allows it to go into so much more depth than any normal episode could. It is not always fighting, giving some time for backstory for Rengoku(who is one of my favorite characters ever), but even those scenes are amazing as they allow you to get attached to the characters. There are the basic anime tropes as well, the loud character, the coward, the hero main, and then Rengoku who I think is given so much more personality than ""The heroic mentor."" Overall an amazing movie, 9/10, and an amazing mixture of heartfelt moments and action."
I only went to see this film after seeing is score on imbd but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.There was plenty of action and a good plot. I didn't understand a lot of it but it was good fun.I would go again to see another film like this.
This movie isn't even a movie or at least it doesn't use the same formula as any other. It's pretty much action for 3/4 of the movie, and the action is absolutely incredible! It's so fluid and amazingly thought out and it comes together so well! The crazy thing is this movie all takes place in the one area, excellent use of setting throughout. There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie.
Let me start by saying I think the show is good albeit it's story pacing is a bit wonky at times but overall good. The movie, on the other hand, spent way too much time trying to exposit things that we haven't seen so it seemingly didn't have to spend the time showing us in the future. It was still good but it often took me out of the moment. It also really didn't move the story forward for the main characters. Watch it but don't feel bad if you come out on the other end feeling kinda meh.
"I heard great things about this movie from my friends, and I was very disappointed after watching it.I was struggling to stay awake during the movie.The ""Character Development"" was very poor.I had felt no connection to the characters.There was not enough battles in the movie.The movie was putting too much weight on the ending of the movie.I think they failed to connect me emotionally to the ending.I wish there was more of a character development to the story.More backstory, to help me connect to the characters.In the end, I think this movie failed."
The newly continuing series of demon slayer: kimetsu no yaiba, with very vibrant art direction and breathtaking action scenes. The producing team also was genius, making the continuing anime series into a movie, that turning into one of the best profitable movie of all time in japan.From all perspective, the storyline, animation or art direction, musics, etc. This movie is flawless.
I had so much fun with this movie, it was only playing in a theatre a half an hour drive away from where I live so I drove to the theatre and was blown away by just how good it was.The animation was amazing. It's was fluid, kinetic and very crisp and detailed. I was a bit hesitant on watching it at first, since I knew this movie would hold some major spoilers for the seiries, and I've only watched the first episode of the anime show since I've only known about it for a week since discovering it on Netflix. This movie does have major spoilers though, but I encourage you to see this in a theatre as soon as you can if tv spoilers bother you or not.I was worried that the whole movie being set on a train would get stale fast, but it is always exciting and doesn't drag a bit. If watching Train To Busan taught me anything, it's that movies set in limited spaces such as trains can still be constantly exciting if it stays engaging. This movie just like Train To Busan isn't entirely set on the train, there are flashbacks and an action sequence seperate from the train.Anyway this was an exceptional movie with very good direction and animation. It was thrilling and also very emotional. Don't miss this one

Until the end...the action shuts up and the tears start :( bruh...it so sad. It's so well done I can't put into words how baffling the ending is. If you've seen the show you gotta continue it sooo good and it leaves it for future projects. :D.
Tanjiro and the others arrive on the Mugen train to meet with the Fire Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku who's investigating the disappearance of people on this train. None of them knowing that this is all part of a plan orchestrated by one of lower rank Kizuki Enmu. *Disclaimer* it is worth noting that unlike most films that are non-canon to the main story. This film is Canon to the manga and if you haven't watched the first season or read to the rehabilitation arc then this movie is a huge spoiler. The first half of the story is more character driven as we delve into the dreams, the minds of the characters. The most part inosuke and Zenitsu don't really have much to offer until later on. The main focus of the story in kept on Rengoku and Tanjiro. The two of quickly develop a bond between them and Kyojuro offers him wisdom that Tanjiro takes to heart as he still blames himself for his family death. Second-half comes around this is where things start to really get intense. The fighting is so crisp and clean this a feature length that's to be expected. However when you actually look at it you can see just how close the show is to this quality. They're are just so over the top and intense especially near the finale you can get lost in it. The setting is of course on a train which offers a compact secluded environment, but if you're expected to see multiple locations you'll be just a little disappoint the entire film takes place on the train. Overall the movie the first looks like it's gonna be more slow burn her things do escalated rather quickly start it and it offers an interesting story intense action and stunning Visuals. The music is beautiful and the visuals and animation is beautiful, once again offering a perfect mixture between CG and Hand drawn.
I am in awe of how beautiful the animation was and how wonderful the movie was. It was by far the best anime movie I have seen.
Es demasiado bonito, y realmente conectas con los personajes, la animaciÃ³n sigue siendo una joya, y la banda sonora, ufff inigualable
A DEMON SLAYER
"Its tricky to write a review for this one because it is not really an usual movie but it's an anime arc and a very serious and the detailed one indeed. As a movie, it was beautiful I would say. Throughout the movie, you would feel various emotions. Some scenes are cute and wholesome, some are sad, filled with regrets, there is a bit of comic relief as well. You may find yourself having a good laugh initially but the ending is sad and emotional.Now, coming back to reviewing it as an arc, this is how it overall went :Story : Beautifully executed. Even though, Enmu was dealt sooner than we expected, the writing is totally justified. We didn't really get to see how Inosuke managed to wake up and break free of that dream but apart from that it was all no-nonsense stuff. There was a thrill but no unnecessary stretching or no unnecessary badasseries. There are few comic relief and cute moments as well. Also, there are quite few classy quotes and I can't get enough of them.Characters : We cannot say that both the villains were purposeless. They are demons and are brilliantly written. By the end of the movie, their respective mindsets were described pretty well. Rengoku too is brilliantly written but I felt we deserved to know more about his father or Rengoku's viewpoint about his father. I am not really sure if we get to know more about him in the upcoming arc. Regardless, Rengoku seemed closer to his mother. Tanjirou as usual a very wholesome character and keeps giving you various feels. But overall, the show belonged to Inosuke. If you guys were waiting for his character development, this is that moment. The movie doesn't offer much to Zenitsu and Nezuko fans but despite that, they do have their respective moments. And rest assured, you will definitely get to hear ""Kaminari no kokyu, ichi no kata. Hekireki Issen!!!""Art : Outstanding animation. Combined with sound effects, it almost feels like a never-seen-before stuff.Sound : I am yet to browse the titles but one thing is for sure, each of those OSTs are absolute fire. We could not have asked for better. Rengoku fans should not miss the end credits.Overall, I enjoyed every bit of this movie."
"From minute zero I had that feeling of crying, it is a very epic and action-packed film, but its best moments stand out (for me) in the sentimental approach. Also, seeing her at the cinema was a unique experiencie.He had very high expectations and not only did he meet them, he surpassed them. ""If i saw this movie alone in my house, it was a sea of tears"" and yes my firend, he is correct."
This was a wonderful movie. I loved evey minute of season one of the show and once I saw the characters get on that train I knew we would see them again. And now here we are. The mugen train. We start with our heroes how they left off now on the train and wondering what will happen to them. We are straight away thrust into danger as some demons turn up and someone tanjuri recognizes turns up to save the day. There is another demon that attempts to kill them in their dreams but they are strong enough to pull through. There are some heartfelt moments and genurally sad ones. Demon slayer mugen train was overall a great movie and translated well to the slightly bigger screen. With beautiful animation as always, lovely voice acting and a great story.
Have no idea if this was good or bad, no idea what was going on except a pig head dude and swords. Dont use this as your foray into the genre, you won't have a clue.

This movie is truly a masterpiece. In the end, I found myself moved so far as to reconsider some of my own core principles and thought processes in life. The concepts and meanings in this movie are truly thought-provoking, and it is executed beautifully. The storytelling allows for a perfect mixture of light-hearted and heavier-set scenes.This story is captivating beyond the words I have to describe it. If I had to choose one word to describe it as closely as possible it would be this: beautiful.Even this falls short of the feeling I wish to convey, and I can't recommend it enough.
Master piece movie rengoku is a top tier character plot twist were fire animation we're good 11/10 movie mangaka is a genius likes she's knows however to portrait here characters Very we'll specially inosuke add tanjiro character development in movies is so good
Before watching, a friend warned me that this would get me emotional, I laughed. I'm not laughing anymore. This was a masterpiece, a very beautiful masterpiece.
LOVED THIS MOVIE. CANT WAIT FOR THE STORY TO CONTINUE, DUBBED OF COURSE...
I'm so glad this movie got an American release. If you loved the animation of the first season, this is an absolute must-see. Find the biggest screen you can and enjoy!The animation. The characters. The situations. The music. The action. The demons. It's all great.Also, try to find a theater with a good sound system. The surround sound really was on another level with the fights.What a movie!
Great movie.. totally enjoyed it
This movie's story is not a great or a new one. We've seen it a million times, in animes and countless fantasies. If you are expecting the movie to tell you one great story, its really not for you.The movie, however does not let you blink. Its just too damn beautiful. Soundtracks, are spot- on and worth listening to over and over again. The animation is... the best out there is any anime. A lot of cliche, more than a few unfunny gags, but the animation makes up for it. The studio really has done their job well to keep me glued to seat.
"With stunning animation and a story that builds upon the first season of the anime, ""Demon Slayer The Movie: Mugen Train"" is a rare film adaptation of a popular anime as it doesn't feel like an extended episode. Though I would recommend watching it especially if you saw season 1, there are some exposition scenes that can be annoying (as well as some of Inosuke's parts)"
Terrible movie
This movie was incredibly well done in many ways.First, the animated fight scenes blew my away. The quality of the animation was spectacular, and I would see it again just to see the fight scenes.But aside from the fighting, the storyline was awesome! It continues right off of where the first season of the anime left off, so if you want to understand everything, WATCH THAT FIRST!!! But on the other hand, people who haven't watched the anime have enjoyed the movie as well. But if you want to save yourself from confusion, watch the first season first.With some inception-like themes, incredible action scenes, and a plot that will have you go through a roller coaster of emotions, this is definitely an animated movie to watch out for!(Note: the only thing I would change is give zenitsu more screen time.)(Another note: this movie got robbed from best animated series nomination for the Oscars. What were they thinking?)
Compliments to the writer for making an amazing anime. I waited for almost 6 months for the release date and it's finally in the US. I've been patient until now to watch such an explicit film. I was speechless! I couldn't think after the movie. I didn't want it to end that way. I love this so much. Please continue to spark the viewers with more of your creative films. Arigato.
Demon Slayer. You've seen it, you love it, so you have to watch Mugen Train. The story continues demonic battles with our three newbie heros, but on a train with Rengoku's help.You'll cringe, you'll cheer, and you'll cry. You will walk away wondering why anime movies are not all made at this quality. The battles are intense, but not quite as beautiful as Rui vs Tanjiro. Hence the 9.
This is literally the best animated movie I have seen, period! It can even compete with full fledged movies it is that good, from the pace of the storytelling to the fight animation and choreography to the breathtaking artstyle everything about it is a treasure for us to enjoy.
If you like season 1 then you will like this movie
Just that perfect blend of heart touching storyline, visually brilliant animation, right intensity of action, and warm emotions that left me at awe after a worthy ending.
Only the visuals are great, the rest is meh.You can't make an excellent anime with just emotions and crying.
I so desperately wanted this film to blow my mind and become my new favorite of all time. It has been a long time coming for shonen anime to capitalize on American markets in a big way. I have no doubts that Demon Slayer will find great financial success here, given that it is the top box office of all time in Japan and the market for season 1 of the show was huge here. I just wish it blew the doors open in an even bigger way.Mugen train is a direct continuation of season 1 of the wildly popular anime Demon Slayer. The animation in the show was already impressive, but it was promised that the studio behind the movie is in an entirely different league. This turned out to be true and then some, with some of the most pulse-pounding, breath-taking action animation I have ever seen. What can't be understated is the brilliant score that pushed these animations to new heights.The story is gripping, with few dull moments and no plot holes. It even had some big surprises that turn the story on a dime. The problem I had with it is that I expect more from shonen anime. I expect some sense of doom and gloom when the protagonist realizes that the antagonist is far beyond his/her power, or vice versa. I expect an even greater threat to be introduced upon the conclusion of any victory. Demon Slayer does both of these things, but meekly.Ultimately, this is a great movie to watch in theatres for the spectacle, even if you haven't seen the show. Seeing the show may add some more depth to the jokes or empathy for the characters, but it certainly isn't necessary. I recommend this film to anyone who has the maturity to brush off the stereotypes of who should or shouldn't go to a shonen anime in theatres.
Great visual with life lessons about dreams and friendship. It was long and a bit dragging. I yawned for a few times. The climax (fighting part) was very exciting.
Truth is, this is just for the fanboys. Not having seen the original series, this movie didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is good, but so are many animes. I just don't care for this style, a little too Pokemonish. Whole story is simple and cliche, action is mediocre. It's no Macross, but it has its moments.
Demon Slayer season 1 was excellent , that is why i was expecting this movie to be a masterpiece as well and masterpiece it was. Movie has an excellent storyline and amazing action sequences , defiently worth a watch.
A piece of art
one reason I refuse to give 10 stars
Almost perfect
Teacher made us to write a review to any film
What a heartbreaking episode !!!!
Its okay. I would say a third of the movie is pretty good to great, and two thirds were bad, overdone, or just too childish. I think younger fans will enjoy it a lot, though.
Demon slayer mugan train
Its not that great. Below my expectation. I just dont feel it. maybe because of the story.
Fans of the television series on which this film is based likely will be moved by this film. However, it is less-accessible to viewers unfamiliar with the characters, situations, and lore established in the series. The film starts out slow, but it steadily picks up speed. Some of the action scenes are quite spectacular, exciting, and intense. While moving, the ending drags on a bit too long. The visuals are impressive, but the animation lacks the fluidity of movement common in many animated features.
I highly recommend giving this anime a shot. The animation is really good. The characters are all unique and I love how the main characters aren't too OP. There are a few emotional scenes that make you feel sorry as well. Good storyline overall.
I didn't think they would top the sakuga seen in s1:e19. In fact I wasn't sure they could. Boy was I wrong. There were a few fights that had the hair on my arms sticking up and a few second in each that made me make an audible, involuntary sound, while I was barely still in my seat. The art direction? Impeccable. The characters? Immaculate. My main issue with the first season of the show was that Inosuke and Zenitsu were beyond infuriating and were on 100% with their personalities 100% of the time. It was still like this in the first third of the movie, but the characters show some other aspects of their personalities as well, and are slightly more tame during the latter half, which I think the majority of the American audience will greatly appreciate. Another issue I had with the first season was that the audience was never able to properly grieve with Tanjiro over his family's death, as they were given less than five minutes of screen time during the original. I'm not going to spoil anything but that has been addressed now, and I've shed tears for them now, or at least for how much their loss impacted Tanjiro. Oh and back to the art direction. You can tell that every single person on akira matsusima's team gave it their all, and loved every minute of it. Every frame bleeds passion, and some left my jaw hanging. The dedication and attention to detail is evident and I cannot give it high enough praise. I am left very curious as to how the show will go on with Tanjiro as the main character without it feeling underwhelming though, now that we see how much his powers pale in comparison to the high ranking slayers and demons. I'm worried it may have went too crazy too soon but we'll have to find out when season two releases. The sound design was astounding as well. I'm obviously no professional movie reviewer, and I may be a little biased because I love Shonen and am a sucker for art, but I honestly found nothing wrong with this movie and really hope I'm not overhyping it when I say- even if you're not a fan of anime as a genre you're doing yourself a great disservice by not seeing this film. And see it in theaters! IMAX if you can. I know we have COVID out here so be safe and weigh the risk, but it's definitely worth ticket price for IMAX.
I'm crying a river, the sound the art the story everything about it are just superb :')
An Epic Movie
Is not an anime! Is an Top level Art
"Highely recommended miss it and u will regret it
By the way u have to watch demon slayer season 1 to fully understand it"
Hit me and my big tiddy mommy milker goth girl like a train, beautiful animation, amazing story. 10/10.
Graphics are amazing the story is good pretty sure we will have a sequel.But even better the music they chose was amazing.All in all very violent not for kids but a great anime for adults.
More Than My Expectation
"I would give 6.5, but I gave 1 as an offset against 10 voted by 40% of people. Nothing can be that perfect, people.I fell asleep twice in the beginning of movie. This is NOT an attempt to degrade the movie. I literally fell asleep a couple of times while I was watching the movie in the beginning. The first half was really that boring, but I decided to finish the movie since I read this was ""big in Japan"". When I passed the half mark of the movie, it was actually getting better and interesting. There were also a couple of awesome moments towards the ending, but that's about it. All I thought was what's a big deal about this? I didn't find anything new. For me, it's just a typical manga and anime that has typical manga and anime moments with different characters which doesn't mean it's bad. It means it's not as new, or progressive as others pointed out. I didn't know about the original series, and I also didn't watch the original series which may be the reason I don't give enough credits to this movie. However, I watched fair share amounts of anime for decades, and I know when it comes to something new."
Tanjiro Kamado, joined with Inosuke Hashibira, a boy raised by boars who wears a boar's head, and Zenitsu Agatsuma, a scared boy who reveals his true power when he sleeps, board the Infinity Train on a new mission with the Flame Pillar, Kyojuro Rengoku, to defeat a demon who has been tormenting the people and killing the demon slayers who oppose it!Nothing more to add here other then if you love the demon slayer series you will definitely enjoy this movie.
I was already a Demon Slayer fan but this movie seriously surpassed my expectations. Great story, emotion, animation and music. Must watch!!
I have cried at the ending so much and so heart touching movie this is best cant say more than that.
"This movie is awesome! Highly recommended!
Better experience if you've watched season 1 and haven't read the manga before!"
"These days it's not easy for us to go out to leisure facilities, needless to say, due to covid-19. Movie theaters are a few exceptions even in Japan where the infection hasn't been relatively severe. That most foreign films don't play this year helps only domestic films such as ""Demon Slayer"" play unusually many times a day.Covid also brought a serious blow to Japanese businesses which had already been in an economic slump for many years. Particularly in the pandemic era, people are likely to lose their ways and not have an idea of what they should do.Demons originally symbolize unknown terrors to humans like earthquakes, eruptions, floods, or plague. The very classic storyline, ""a brave boy who has a sense of justice beats demons"", gives people hope for salvation and brings about catharsis. The old-fashioned and creepy ambiance depicted by a lavish, high-quality animation exactly fits with the current time."
Wow! My son got really good grades so I agreed on taking him and and my girlfriends son to see Mugen Train and I ain't gonna lie I was a bit skeptical about it. I heard little bits hear and there about the series but wasn't ever enough to draw me in. We live an hour away from the cinema and on our way to see it knowing there was a series about it I asked the boys to fill me in. Just on listening to them explain the twists and plot of the series was enough to get me interested in it.. After watching the movie tho I was hooked, glued and tied to idea that I needed more! I since then have seen the first season and have become an instant fan! The effects and awesome story line is great! Heart felt feelings that I love to feel and see when watching movies! So definetly a great movie I can't wait for season 2 to drop so I can continue on with Tanjiro, Inosuke, Zenitsu, and Nezuko Journey!
"I enjoyed season 1 of the anime, and this movie's IMDB rating and reviews got me very excited to watch this.However, this movie was a pretty big disappointment for me. From an animation perspective, the 3D work on this movie was passable but really quite mediocre, and paled in comparison to the hand-drawn 2D aspects of the animation.The biggest offender for me, and what got me to almost quit the movie before it ended, was the terrible, atrociously poor writing. It felt like 80% of the movie was the various characters laboriously telling and retelling what they were thinking and how they were feeling. There was pretty much no attempt at ""show instead of tell"" when it comes to character struggles. It was just .... a constant barrage of ""This is what I'm thinking right now.""Compared to modern animated productions and cinema in general, this aspect of the movie was a huge fail and gratingly annoying."
The whole anime in general is amazing. The story is intriguing. The way the characters were created is really good. I mean the quality. I think it deserves 10/10. It is really a well-planned introduction to season 2.
The movie has 3 parts. The first is just the main group hanging around on the train, and trying to figure out what is going on there. It has a very eerie feeling overall, where you know for sure something is up. I liked this part very well, it somehow reminds me of a creepier Harry Potter, with kids solving evil mysteries and all that.The second part is a long fight scene against some tentacle lady (or guy?), which was far too drawn out in my opinion, the oucome was a foregone conclusion and made no impact. The third part was very cool. It's also just a long fight scene, but this one carried a lot more emotional investment, and was overall much more interesting.Overall, animation, acting, music and storytelling are all very good, and it keeps everything together and makes it quite enjoyable. However, the script is very weak. Characters have no development, except maybe some of them being somewhat sadder by the end. The plot also is incomplete and does not warrant a 2 hour movie. Most scenes are drawn-out. There is no introduction and background, and no conclusive ending. If you saw the series I guess it will all make sense so do watch it, but if you, like me, didn't, it doesn't, so don't.
Finally
Only for people who already know and love the franchise
If you watched the S1 you will find deep connection to the characters and especially rengoku the flame hashira who's story is basically being told here Characters fight sequences music animation everything is breathtaking and you can't watch the ending without stream of tears definitely one of my favorites.
Truly a masterpiece the fight scenes are incredible and the animation mixed with the voice acting truly took this to another level I hope we see more of this in the future.
"#DemonSlayerTheMovieMugenTrain (2020)
One of the best anime films of all-time, filled with comedy mixed with emotional and action filled moments.There aren't any words for how beautiful the scenery and animation were in small moments.Overall, this is one of the greatest films ever to be seen and I hope you all enjoy it!I recommend this movie to every single person who has previously watched the series.#Anime #Otaku."
The only word I can say is it's one of the best animated movie so far the storyline,the character development, animation and bgm is truly fascinating.
I am not the one who is too much engrossed in anime. Even I watch majority of anime can't make me hooked in it. But not this time. This is best thing I ever seen on screen. The animation, story and message it try to convey to its viewer is just praiseworthy. The way the movie has ended is just great. I was completely speechless and scattered the way the movie has ended. Wonderful character development and plot. MUST WATCH.
Must watch movie for those who watch anime! Highly recommended !!!! 1st thing you have to complete demon slayer season 1 than watch this movie, it can help you to understand the story line , 10/10 mixed with emotion & everything. So what are you waiting for jump into this roller coaster of everything....
"""Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-Hen"" is a good animated film, the script is cool, the music score is wonderful and the animation is beautiful. The story is gory and funny, the first 90 minutes are really awesome, but the last 30 minutes are weak. Good anime movie but not perfect!"
"If you have seen other shounen anime or simply other live-action films like the MCU, it's going to be hard to top those. This film delivers amazing visuals, but it is one of those stories that is more about the emotion than the logic of the plotline, which doesn't sit well with people like me. There were various scenes in the film where beneficial things happen to the protagonist and I reacted with ""No, that's a little bs.""In short, the film seems more like an extended series episode than a theatrical standalone title, which I believe is the intention."
Visually STUNNING but still a let down for me. I liked it better than the anime, though!I had issues with the pacing, misplaced comedy and character building with the anime, same issues with the movie. I didn't get the hype then, don't get it now.Don't get me wrong, I'd have gladly watched 52 episodes instead of the 26 from season 01. Would have liked the movie as a 26 episode show instead of a < 2 hr movie. Why rush it, especially people will pay for more content!? *smh*The movie is a visual treat nevertheless, has some hype music in parts, and shows glimpses of how amazing it could be (for me to enjoy it) but this style of storytelling isn't for me so I'll let you make your own opinion.
Not sure why this is rated to highly. I watched it thinking it would be good, but quickly realized that this is meant for teenagers at best. The characters seem to have been created by children trying to pretend they were adults.
"I am from Bangladesh. I am waiting for it for long timeðŸ™ƒ.
It is resaled in japan but what for us?"
"Guys I guess it's masterpiece from ufotable best movie
The best ðŸ‘Œ"
"The follow on story from season 1 worked very well.
The animation was fantastic and the story had all the upside and downs a great movie should have!"
This movie able to introduce new character to the installment and yet people is already attached to it. Superb animation from Ufotable and the soundtrack is able to fit in to the atmosphere. I have watch it twice in the Cinema and still waiting for the digital release.
Best anime film ever. Super awesome ðŸ˜. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
Great voice acting great plot great story absolutely subarashi
How do you watch this? Because I'm very confused do I pay or do I watch it on here
Nothing compared to the series but overall an okay movie
This movie is one of the best movie ever made in the anime history... Even your name doesn't come any closer to this movie it's worth watching this movie.
This movie isn't enjoyable if you are not already watching the enemy. It is not a bad movie but if you want to enjoy it go watch the enemy first.
The movie has about 10minutes of non-essential crap stuffed into it with unnecessary dream sequences. This 10 minutes of dream sequences add NOTHING to the story or the series' plot. It's literally wasting 10 minutes of screen time, for mindless drivel.The other big issue is the fact that Kyojuro Rengoku was portrayed like an idiot in this movie.... like somebody who doesn't take fighting seriously and somebody who when fighting doesn't give 110% from the start. This is purely done by the show's creators to build fake suspense and to create a fictitious ending for the movie. ANY time that a character doesn't give 110% from the very start of the fight when facing a very powerful opponent, it is poor writing by the show's creators and especially when it's as poorly done as it was in the Kyojuro Rengoku fight, then it just spoils the character's legacy and completely spoils the 'twist ending', which I was able to see coming miles away.Overall these two dumb design decisions by the show's creators above, really brings the movie down from what could have been an 8/10, to a 5/10. It's not worth watching in the cinemas either, as it really is just 2 bad episodes from the show that are stitched together. 5/10 as a movie, and considering that you'd normally pay to watch it, i'd even bring that down to 4/10 because it's costing you money. Very poor showing from an otherwise good series.
"Season 1 of demon slayer was not that serious, it was a bit generic and overrated.But this movie made the series so much more mature and meaningful.This is not about a ""boy who isn't talented and wants to get stronger"" (naruto, black clover, my hero academia etc..).This is a war between Humans and Demons, and War is always tragic. So much lives are lost in wars, which makes both sides suffer even the winner.Those last 30 minutes were a roller coaster of emotions and amazing animation.Thank you ufotable for this gem."
"If you have been watching and enjoying the anime on netflix, this is a must watch.
Unlike some anime movies that simply recaps the TV series, this movie continues on from Season 1, and acts as a perfect segue into Season 2.There is a mix of everything in this movie, from exhilarating battle scenes to melancholy and poignant reflection, and not to forget the comedy we have come to expect from the protagonist trio.I normally would not watch a movie twice, but this movie will be the exception.
Ufotable forever!"
Any thing you hear see or feel or get to know about this movie, and you think its just HYPE, NOOO!!! It is the ground truth. For a long time I was sure no anime/movie can beat AOT story line, but here we are with a MOVIE DEFEATING WHOLE FULLY DEVELOPED ANIME'S.
U shouldn't be missed it. It'd be worth watching go nd watch. This movie makes you cry cz it has some emotional moments. Everything was top notch. Hat's off to creators.
I started watching Japanese anime after Death note and everytime it surprises me with its unique fantasy story. It was my first anime movie and I must admit, it's worth watching.
Please dont watch the DUB Version
Oh my god, the overall feelings I got form this movie was out of this world. I loved it so much, ufotable does it again and again, bravo! ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ Amazing animation and brilliant characters make this movie the best imoðŸ˜…
"It was a descent, direct continuation of the 1st season, but it could have been better. Besides the well executed action sequences, the core story is just not that good. Before watching it, based on the ratings and reviews, I was foolishly expecting the Anime equivalent to ""Train to Busan"" in terms of story/suspense, just with demons instead of zombies, but I was sorely disappointed. The animation was top notch, as expected, as was the voice acting, but the story was nothing we haven't seen done better in a million other anime. Also, it relied a little too much on sentimentality for my tastes. The series did it as well, but it was well spaced in 26 episodes, while here it is condensed in 2 hours and it gets a bit much. It's well worth two hours of your time, especially if you are a fan of the series like me, but you shouldn't go expecting a masterpiece. I think that the pandemic helped this movie becoming so popular, in a normal season it definitely wouldn't have surpassed ""Spirited Away"" in ticket sales. Now, that WAS a real masterpiece."
CUAse I cAnT WaatCh iT insane absolutely bonkers can't wait for season 2 had me on the top of my seat the whole movie
It probably would've helped if I'd seen the TV series that spawned his film. I've had a little background from my clued up daughter, but really I'm going in cold. We're at the cinema though, this is the first film I've seen on a big screen in nearly two years. It needs to be seen on a big screen really, it's all about the spectacle. This is a shame seeing as it's only screening for one day in the UK. The plot. It's pretty straightforward. There are demons, that are bad and demon slayers, that are good. Some young slayers including Tanjiro, his sister who's in a box with a muzzle because she's a demon (but a good one) and a dude wearing a boar mask (I thought he was a boar for a large part of the film) are boarding a train to meet and learn from a Hashira who's some kind of demon slayer master who doesn't blink. He's there though to protect the passengers from a demon on board, who seems styled on one of Tim Burton's fantasies, with a detachable hand with its own mouth that's reminiscent of Thing from the Addams Family. It's very trippy, our heroes attacked in their dreams as they're put to sleep, the demon taking over the train in a weird flubber meets The Abyss tendrils, with millions of eyes that pop out of nowhere. It looks very cool. There is an odd mix of animation styles though, from quite simple flat comic book stuff to scenes with beautiful depth. The fight scenes though of which there are many are where it excels. The pace is blistering, the screen awash with colour as as techno rock score blasts away. It's pretty frenetic and to be honest the story is very simple at its core. It's fun though, but I'm not sure I'll be getting into the TV show. I've already missed three seasons. So it's good guys killing bad guys, moral codes, fighting with honour. I feel like I've missed a lot of the back story, but it still works as a stand-alone film.
Passable at best. Very wonky and predictable plot, graphics are OK. Characters are quite two-dimensional, no deep character work. Amusing enough to watch once, but definitely not something I would ever watch again. I would have never watched it if not for the racing reviews, and now that I did, I'm both disappointed and surprised at all the fuss. It's definitely not worth it.
"One of my favorite movie. May be the storyline is normal... main theme of this type anime is""kill the demons,protect the humans"".that's all.. bt still i really like how the story was represent... and the animation was mind-blowing."
Really is as good as everyone says
I'm a huge anime fan, so I'm constantly watching all kinds of different shows. I hadn't got to Demon Slayer quite yet since its release in 2019, but I started it this past week. I saw that the new movie was in theaters and did really well worldwide, so I just had to see it. (It's already the highest grossing anime film of all-time!) I binge watched all 26 episodes of Season 1 this week and I saw the movie today.Let me tell you, it is absolutely sensational. Season 1 itself was already just so good, so this movie was a fantastic addition to the series. The animation is flawless and done so well. The raw emotions pack a huge punch, similar to Season 1's sentimental aspects. The characters are continued and developed through a clever, exciting, and action-packed ride aboard the Mugen Train! The soundtrack fit perfectly, as it added just the right touch at the exact right time. Even though I just watched Season 1 this last week, I'm already a huge fan! This anime is already a masterpiece and it will only continue to amaze everyone over time!
This movie is epic, who ever has not watched this movie, you are missing something special. .. movie of the century.
I was already expecting a masterpiece but It still surpassed my expectations . Some of the scenes just send chills down my spine . I was laughing , edge of the seat , emotional throughout the 1hour 56 minutes journey including end credits . And even then there were some brilliant life lessons as well . Well and truly 10/10.
Please watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The story and the way they ended it made me shed couple of tears for how beautiful it was. Outstanding voice acting by the Japanese performers.
The way the movie makes you show emotion especially at the ending just shows you how far demon slayer has come.
sexy animation but questionable writing..
Review By Kamal KThe story starts from where the anime left, the mugen train. As a part of the main story this movie fully illustrates its main theme which revolves around the train. As a sequel to the anime its great that the story shifts to new characters, also introducing new elements like dream, awesome techniques etc. Its also refreshing to see the Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke develop in strength and capabilities. The art was excellent, detailing every bits, all the scenes and lighting takes the audience into the movie, which is a great experience. Most of all, the emotions and encouragement it shares is absolutely mind blowing and gives strength to all the hearts of audience.
First of all what happen to that killer intro song!!! Gurenge by Lisa - This is one of the best sound tracks I have come across which was perfect for this show. Every episode, I never skipped it, even though I didn't understood a word. It just gave an unspeakable feeling to the show. Here, I missed it a lot like I was almost watching something else. When you start to watch something after a long break you need to remind why you loved it and this song was it!! Hope they don't screw the second season by using another intro!!!Other than that it was fine, but for a movie, I expected something more, something grand! That's probably why at the end there was another unexpected battle to compensate, which for me it felt out of place! Good battle for sure, but really didn't make sense at that moment.Tv series was far more superior in every way than the movie hands down and I really, really, really hope that they make the 2nd season soon with the same sound track!!!!!!
Is this comedy or serious action-adventure? Is this movie or TV series? I don't understand. I quit watching. Only for kids.
Must watch for all fans of the show. This has the emotional depth and the beautiful animation of the show. The climax comes out unexpectedly but still reaches the emotion we have seen in the show.
With Demon Slayer already being a phenomenal series, I have to say that this movie was somehow still more than I could have hoped for, even going in with high expectations. It really fires on all cylinders: the animation is out of this world, the musical score was wonderful, the story itself was gripping and emotional. Go see it in theaters if there's still time! You won't regret it.
A touching piece of art, full of emotions and motivations. In my opinion, they managed to make one of the best plots to introduce a powerful and cool new character and leave its impact on us and the series.ðŸ‘Œ
Made me cry just with simple scenes and no bgm attached
Very very fast-paced, satisfying, and awesome, especially for fans of Demon Slayer. It continues the story tremendously, revealing more about the world of demon slayer, and makes me excited to see what happens next.
The movie takes you to a wonderful journey in which you constantly gain and losses.
The final fight scene between Akaza and Rengoku is the best fight scene I have ever seen (before that the duel between Uma and Lucy in the Kill Bill 1 was my most favorite). Not only the best fight scene, but in the same movie, I found the best villain and a hero a single movie can produce. Akaza is not only powerful but also very smart and cunning. He appears at the last part of the movie and remains only for less than 20 minutes but in that duration what he did is unforgettable. Rengoku was very brave and skillful but luck was not on his side. I feel sorry for him. So far I have seen that fight scene countless times but I enjoy it every time I see it. The background sound during the fights is incredible.
The BEST Anime Movie
Everything is just amazing and reasonable. They gave every single character its chance to shine. This is just amazing and I hope season 2 would be lot better. I watched it twice and still couldn't move my eyes off the screen. I just didn't need to see the last scene of Gyomei Himejima praying cause I don't like religions in movies. Everything else is amazing.
The movie Demon Slayer: Mugen Train followed directly where the first season of the tv show ended. It shows the group around the main protagonist Tanjiro going on a train as a next mission for the demon slayer corps. I'll not go further into detail about the story, but I think it is necessary for the movie to watch the tv show, or at least a summary. There is no introduction into the world of demon slayer. The story, the animation and the music are basically the same like the tv show. That means the story is still pretty generic, with characters, which are mostly flat and some still annoying.(Some of my major critic points with the movie (contains spoiler!): At the end something tragical happened, but the audience didn't get to know the person fully to feel much about it. Therefore the pain and the tears from the protagonist, were not really understanable. They just got introduced to the person like 3 hours ago maybe. The other point was why was there a rank 3 demon so suddenly? And why is the protagonist not longer interested in taking blood samples? Why are the only talking about the highest rank in the corps, what about all the other ranks?)The animation is still amazing and beautiful! Just sometimes the cgi was a little bit too much for me, but overall it is really top. Same goes for the music. Really nice and well fitting.The tv show is overhyped, same goes for the movie. Yes, the animation is beautiful and the music and style are okay. But is it a masterpiece ? No, not for me. It has a quite childish humour, the characters have only one personal trait, everything can be categorized in good or bad. The standard pattern as you can see.
"Cheap consumerism. Nothing more.Yes, of course this ""movie"" is ""amazing"":
There is one good thing about it: The animation.That being said, the movie is awful. Just like the show. The arcs are awful - if not non-existant - and the main protagonist once again has to tell, or rather yell that he is dedicated to saving humanity, his sister etc. Nothing changes. No challenges, no development - nothing. Just nice colours on screen.This has 8.2. The series in general has 8.5. This is higher than movies like Logan, In the Name of the Father, Dead Poets Society and Catch Me If You Can which all have 8.1. Scarface, A Space Odyssey and Oppenheimer have 8.2.It is evident to me that people like anime. That does not make them art. Go learn what makes a piece of media good and what it takes to challenge our views and connect us to our human nature. It's ok if someone likes something that is not good. For example I like the prequels of SW. That doesn't mean I'll go and give them a 10.Don't watch something that will actually be thought provoking and (to quote a not so well known philosopher) ""human all too human"". Instead, go ahead: Choose to turn off your brain and drool while you ""experience this piece of art""."
"Kimetsu no Yaiba is a story that all shonen fans need to watch, the characters are lovable each in their own ways and throughout the 2 hours of film you'll find yourself in a tornado of emotions.Great fights, good animation, humor and the feel train is high with this one.I can't remember the last time I got this emotional over an anime; I cant wait to see where this story will take us!"
This movie blew my expectations out of the water. It was one of those movies you wish didn't end. I usually don't cry at movie theaters, but damn that ending got me teary eyed. What a fine masterpiece this move was. Definitely a film I would recommend to any anime fan!!
You Gotta see it to believe it, Movie is Just Perfect. I never wrote a movie review but here I am, what a masterpiece.
"... as this is now the highest-grossing film in Japan by a very long shot. It made 40 billion Yen followed by ""Spirited Away"" with almost 32 billion (and ""Titanic"" with a measly 26 billion). So it is proof of the strength of the Japanese industry as opposed to most other countries (except India), in that domestic animation totally overrules Disney (as it should everywhere).Its enormous success has a lot to do with a lack of alternatives, with no US features theatrically released in CoVid year. And it's really not as great as ""Spirited Away"", which is a totally unforgettable classic. Still, for a tie-in film it's very good and gives the characters from the series more depth.Lots of the suspicious three-liner reviews here neglect the story, so I'll tell you this much: there are two parts involving two villains, the first of which taking place in the title-giving demon train. This will be pleasing for fans of the series, but those who took issue with the support characters going overboard all the time - brace yourselves. The 2D/3D mix doesn't work so well, and they should have come up with something more original than tentacles, but the action is non-stop and the premise enticing. Still, if it would end after 85 minutes, it would be nothing special.But then the really bad guy shows up. And the really awesome hero must show his marbles. And this is pure joy and the most spectacular 2D animation this side of Heaven. And yes, the resolution is extremely moving, unless your heartstrings snap along the way. It's totally insane and divine. So you have a slow 2/3rds along the lines of what you'd expect and then a glorious third act that elevates it above the ""Fate/Stay Night"" films.I'd still call ""Attack on Titan"" the better franchise but that's not for kids and on a whole other level of awe. This one is OK to take your 12-year-olds to as the violence is sufficiently rooted in fantasy and they're gonna watch it anyway."
I absolutely loved the Demon Slayer anime. I actually watched it as it was coming out. I was on the way to Japan to celebrate my birthday too, so the anime is a reminder of that wonderful trip. Anyway, the movie was spectacular. The animation and actions scenes were beautifully done. I went with three of my friends and we all enjoyed it.
Most of the time i don't type reviews but man this movie is on another level everything in it is nearly perfect the animation,ost, storyline.It's just perfect.
Is it going to release in Indian theatre, I really want to confirm about this so badlyyyy
I liked this movie overall and would probably go see it again, just because the art was so beautiful and the score and sound design really hyped up all the good moments! However, and I know this is marketed for kids, the characters were not great. I'm not familiar with the anime, so I went into this movie blind, and I think it accommodates this kind of audience in a good way! But, there is way too much unnecessary crying and one dimensional characters. There's basically just single quality stereotypes being made into main characters, and it really detracts for me.
This movie has everything: emotional depth, action, comedy and great acting. So pleased it's become the highest grossing movie of all time in Japan. Can't wait for season 2. :)
The humour is so cheesy and the tentacles of the demon are weird, like bad 90s CGI. This film was so hard to watch. The last fight with Rengoku is worth watching though. It's the only thing I liked about the film.
Anime fans are delusional. This movies' ranked over stuff like Nashville, Mulholland Drive, Stagecoach and so many other classics. But it got the same amateurish writing as in the anime series and the same annoying characters. Tanjiro is bland as hell and spouts generic hero lines every few minutes. Zenitsu is absolutely annoying and Nezuko is just there to look cute. The only upside is the animation, but pixar movies still got 10x better animation.And if you wanna actually watch some great anime stuff go watch Miyazaki movies. Every single one of his movies is better than this pile of garbage.
WHAT AN AMAZING ANIME MOVIE!!!
Sequel of an Anime Series in Movie should be made like this that every single watcher can jump off from the seat from the dose of joyfullness and every emotion can be tweaked by the sequence with build up.I am so happy yet so sad that couldn't watch this in theatres it would have be an pleasure to my eyes if I would have able to watch this in Indian theatres all thanks to the mindfu*king virus the lockdown didn't let the theatres open and I have to enjoy this Piece of Art on my Phone but still it was very very eye pleasing if by any chance the theatres release this movie in India I will definitely go and watch after all it's an Ufotable movie.For Demon Slayer Anime it's an amazing continuation with some amazing,stunning,dazzling Animation and Soundtracks which did justice to the Demon Slayer Story beautifully so it is absolutely a must watch just follow the series you'll love it.
A great story of love, kindness, abnegation and duty.It's way above of what Western animation has produced in moral sense.
"So far the ratings of this masterpiece movie ""8.5"" on IMDB is really unacceptable to me! I've watch 90% of all Animes, and I can tell you this without doubt this movie got one of best music, and Shounen Fights out there! Over all in my opinion Demon Slayer is easily ranked along with the best Animes up to date besides Attack on Titans, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece, Naruto Shippuden, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, One Punch, Boku No Hero Academia, and Code Geass.Just imagine that an hour and 56 mins movie got me so emotional that I even cried, and laughed in a small movie, and that alone might tell everyone, HOW GOOD KIMETSU NO YAIBA IS !"
One of the most impactful anime movies i've ever watched
This movie is really a roller coaster for me. It is full of emotions, action and feelings.The fights sense are really awesome. Specially the end hits hard.The animation in this movie is really on the another level...I loved the animation.
"Honestly I watched this one a while ago so I forget how I felt about it. Generally positive; the action is cool, of course Â¯\_(:3)_/Â¯"
This movie is a work of art. The animation is very smooth and the story is written beautifully. If you've watched and liked the first season then you won't be disappointed. The movie does a great job connecting the audience to Rengoku's character. The fight sequences are fantastic and had me almost jumping out of my seat. I definitely recommend this movie.
I finally gave in to peer pressure and finally sat down to watch the overnight MEGA-hit. After watching it and the credits started to roll, my first thought was that I could totally understand and respect this being someone's all-time favorite anime. It's gorgeous and may have perfected some of the anime tropes. So, I totally appreciate the love here. For me, it's just ok. Those 'perfected tropes' are still familiar anime devices that I don't particularly enjoy. The art style doesn't work for me in some cases, everyone looks so young and weird. At the end of the day, I'm picky with anime and this one didn't quite make the cut and I can't imagine that I would ever feel inclined to revisit it. Still pleased to have seen it so I can properly relate to the massive sensation it became.
Yes this Movie was a continuation of the Season 1 of demon Slayer not sure if it is canon or not but it did have the same animators and voice actors. Anyone who liked the first Season of Demon Slayer will absolutely love this, anyone who has watched the first season of the show must watch it. SO worth the time. This time with better Animation and More powerful demons. Just wish it had more of the backstory like why they were boarding there train for people who haven't watched season 1 besides that absolutely I loved it.
This was such an interesting fun ride. Made me cry, laugh, amazed, wowed. I have read the manga already last year, I wish I would not have read it. Anyone planning to watch this series don't read the manga.THE MOVIE IS EPICCC.
A movie of sadness, RENgoku was in spotlight , animation was cool.
Incredible... So many nerve-tingling, adrenaline-packed moments to experience on this emotional rollercoaster of a ride. I'm surprised it's not rated higher, by far the best film I've watched!
Ufotable just set the bar too high and you will be absolutely speechless.
What an emotional ride this movie was, for someone who has already watched the 1st season of the anime this will make sense. I mean watching the movie without knowing what happened before, it wouldn't be the same! I expected something really good, but the movie delivered even more. The art/animation was exceptional as usual, but it also added more than just that and a great fight...it was also very emotional. Demon Slayer keeps growing especially for those who haven't read the manga, I haven't and I chose not to because I wanna watch it first. If that's the story so far I cannot even imagine what's gonna happen in the next chapters of the story. Just finished also the 2nd season and I gotta tell you, it get's even better!
Honest review. This movie only makes sense and entertain demon slayer's comic book readers but still a huge disappointment. This arc shouldve been potrayed in series instead of making it into a film. A big waste of time, unlike in the comic they made it too comedic and less sympathetic for tanjiro and rengoku. Dont trust other overrated reviews on this film. Doesnt worth the hype. Shame on the biased reviewers.
I had watched just few initial episodes of tv series before watching the movie. But movie is complete in itself and you can watch movie straight away. Screenplay, plot, music all are superb.
I don't think I could tell this apart from the first season of demon slayer...which is not bad just stating that this could as well have been part of a season.The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack phenomenal.
To like this film, beside it's wonderful animation, you REALLY have to like shounen anime, 'cause it's got 0 subtance plotline wise.
Mugen Train is a movie which won't fail your expectations. I promise. The visuals and the artistic style were top notch as expected from Ufotable. The Story wasn't the most promising point but didn't let down the overall experience. It helps to build up the excitement for the second season. The background score was on point and a treat to ears. Overall a balanced movie as all movies should be.
"Simply put; Demon Slayer:Mugen Train is one of the BEST anime films. The simplicity of the story, the interesting characters, the animation, the uniqueness of the breathing techniques, the fight scenes are truly spectacular. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥"
This movie is beautiful animated and with an excellent soundtrack, Its better if you watched the 26 episodes of the first season, it's canon to the original manga its not filler and that's great, im excited to see what's it's going to happen in season 2, also is a very emotional movie even more than the first season, ufotable is a great animation studio, the lighting and design of the demons and slayers is something special, Rengoku is a great character. 10/10.
"Only 10?! Kidding me?! It's truly worth 100! For the time being, it's one of the most touching pieces of work I've ever witnessed! I'm shook...
Broadly speaking, this movie exemplifies lots of essential moral values our society might disregard such as compassion, faith, loyalty and dignity. I was literally staggered at both meaningful plot twists and mere passable moments. Being completely well-aware of an emotional and heartbreaking ending, I, however, could not possibly imagine that it was gonna turn out to be totally unprecedented and even unexpected!I'm still flabbergasted and utterly frustrated with all the implication followed by the demise of one significant hero, but, hopefully, it's gonna be settled and thoroughly explained in the following episodes. The score and those final scenes will undoubtedly stuck in my head!Totally recommended! Hats off!"
I watched this movies a while after it was released so I already got a major spoiler but watching this movie was just amazing. The animation is on a completely different level than other animated movies I've seen. I loved the series but honestly the movie outshined it. Perfect combination of fighting and intensity along with emotion and soul. I cried multiple times while watching and I have nothing bad to say about this movie. It was just perfect.
I watched this movie and didn't watch the anime series just watched this, and wow i want to watch the anime series live. But I think it's okay not to see the anime series just watch this movie but, if you watch the anime series you won't be as surprised as those who watched the previous anime series.
This is not the movie you just watch because you have heard about this anime, but as a continuation of the excellent anime series, most enjoyable. Really do like the art direction and score. Sure, it could probably do with some excess edits, but then again, its a movie, just sit back and enjoy the world and the ongoing strange stories these anime shows toss up.
Best time of my life. Very satisfied watching this film. This movie gives all sensation you can get through a movie. Especially the last part. I highly recommend this film to everyone. Including people who have seen the manga will definitely be more amazed.
This story arc worked as a transicion between the major arcs and introduced us to one of fans favorite xharacters. The ending of the arc though is very powerful, maybe one of the best scenes of the entire show. The boss fight of the mugen train was a bit lame but the insane animation is a good counterbalance.I watched the show that came after the movie and waiting weekly for new episodes was hard. I think the movie was the better idea. I think this movie also serves as an example for the ideal anime movie: No filler, but an inportant role in the main story and animation that is worth for being seen in a cinema.
Watched the original Japanese sub for season 1 of demon slayer. Thought about spicing up my life by seeing what the English dub of demon slayer was like. Just decided to make things a little interesting.Did you know Inosuke's English dub makes him sound like an incel? That s#!% is wild. 100% makes him a more robust character.If Demon Slayer isn't your thing, its still a solid movie to meme.
Great anime, highly recommended. The main character and the minor ones are not infuriating, some are very happy. A very active beginning, a high rate of development of events watched in one breath, then it became a little hard, but still the story pleases, there is always some variety of demons, which can not but please. The drawing is excellent, respect for the artist.
Great movie! Most beautiful animation I have ever seen.
Best movie of 2021 and they carried it amazingly well from the series and is a continuation to it.
Truly a stunning masterpiece!
All the people complaining about this movie don't follow the series or read the manga. Y'all lost we get it but don't come here to complain. Instead, give credit where credit is due. This series is great and it will continue to be great without you. The Japanese voice actors did a great job!!!! The graphics and their voices are what make this series so amazing. Not disappointed at all. I will continue to watch the series in Japanese the demons their voices are amazing. Enmu does not disappoint at all. Rengoku will be missed.
I haven't seen the anime before but this movie is definitely making me consider watching it. Pretty solid experience overall, packed with a lot of emotion especially towards the end.
"""Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha - Hen"" or the Demon Slayer Train Movie, is the continuation of the story and the bridge between the first season and the second season.Taking place on the train, it introduces new characters and it also gives a solid story to follow. The dream world moments were quite touching, with the main character recalling his family moments, now long gone. The comedy relief was plenty and balanced the bitterness of the dreams, as well as the hectic action of the story.As for the art, it was nice, just what one should expect from the Demon Slayer series, with bright colors, the right hair and costumes for the fantasy genre, as well as well crafted action scenes for the shounen fans and the rigtht amount of body horror. The OST was brilliant as well. However, the use of technology and special effects was unecessary and set off the whole aesthetic.So, overall, seven out of ten."
"""Demon Slayer:Mugen Train"" is one of the best fantasy films of recent times in my opinion, that released in 2020 and became the highest-grossing anime film. Sotozaki Haruo is film director. The plot revolves around Tanjiro and his partners from the organization ""Demon slayers"". Their goals are explore the train , destroy the demons and find out all the strange things that happen on this train .The plot is thrilling and animation is amazing. I really liked the soundtracks. They are very exciting. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes anime or wants to get an impression. I especially recommend it to those who like mysticism and fights with demons."
They have improved alot in animation and above average plot. I recommend after watching season 1 of demon slayer (26 episodes) and after this movie season 2(11 episodes).
If you watched the Demon slyer would really be happy to watch this movie, it's continued the story. Hope to see more coming. Ne er thought anime would made me emotional but this it did sas ending.
I'm almost 45 years old and had the fight back tears while watching this with my Daughter.We love it.
If u don't have wanted it yet u should give it a try. And although many people have to seem trouble to watch the movie or arc I would prefer movie it's time saving but of u like rengoku u should watch 1 Episode of Mugen Train Arc Because the episode only focus on rengoku and it's not shown in the movie and the rest of episode 2,3,4,5,6 contains main story which is shown in the movie accept ep 1 and some scenes in ep 7.
...this is a masterpiece. From the soundtrack. To the animation. To the set pieces. To the emotions. Honestly, one of my favourite films I've ever seen and that's saying a lot. What a ride.
Good films
Didn't know anything about the series or the characters but this is such a good story I really didn't find that mattered. It's captivating throuout, flows wonderfully, looks beautiful and it's just a joy to watch. Take two hours out and you really won't be disappointed...
Became a fan of the show but was misled by commercials in English. It's subtitled but that takes away from watching the movie.
I went blind in this one. I knew the premise of Demon Slayer more or less, but never watched an episode or read any manga chapter for this serie.The movie is simply a masterpiece.
Not really a movie and apart from the last act nothing really worked for me
It was unbelievable WOW !
Demon Slayer Mugen-Ressha-HenMade in 2020Main character ,Tanjiro, fights demos for turning his demon sister to human. In the Long fighting with demons, he is ordered to go to the Mugen train for beating the demon who eats passengers. And his colleagues and boss cooperate him. He can beat the demon? And how their fate is?It is the best anime movie I have ever seen. At first, landscape and pictures are so beautiful. Second you may be impressed with Tanjiro. He loves his family, but his family is killed. When you finish watching, you will realize how important your family is. At last, many sword technics appear, so children may enjoy watching. It is suitable for watching with someone.
Best animations along with the amazing story. I was crying at the end of the movie. There is no point in the movie where you feel boring.
Excellent movie, like the rest of the anime. It was a great idea to make a movie with this part of the plot.
I swear this is one of the most amazing movie I've seen recently since COVID, the animation is art. This movie is art the story, the characters and fight scenes are ðŸ”¥. Dont mind these toxic haters jealous because this movie was so successful, go P/ss off somewhere else.
Anyone who enjoyed season 1 needs to watch this, preferably in the cinema because the sound and animation quality is amazing as always (I watched in a Dolby Digital theatre).Was on the edge of my seat the majority of the movie. I love that it starts and ends nicely. Because it's canon with the original storyline, it's a mandatory watch going into season 2. Perhaps that's why it was so good - since it is part of the original manga.
Masters piece movie one in a Life times stuff what's a goat character is rengoku
yes
Great continuation of the 1st season. The music of the movie was just as great as it was in the actually show. The action sequences in the movie were absolutely fantastic. They were filled with the same gore and filled you with a sense of excitement. Although it is a little slow in the beginning states of the movie, it picks up in the later stages I assure you.
It's as good as the show, but maybe even better, real stakes and arguably the best action of the entire show, with the animation as good or better than before, and the comedy landing on every attempt. From start to finish enjoyable and action packed!!
For me this thr best movie in this year everything is perfect in this movie he deserves the oscar.
Not gonna lie, I started balling my eyes out while watching this movie at the theater. I'd been waiting so long for it to come out in theater here in the US and now that it finally is, I can genuinely say that it was worth the wait! The action, the comedy, the cute moments from Nezuko are all what you expected it'd be...FREAKING TOP TIER!! It's breathtakingly beautiful all throughout the movie and getting to watch it on the big screen just amplifies the experience by 1,000. So if you enjoyed the first season of the anime, you won't be disappointed by the movie!
Best movie ever .... Better then the endgame.... Blasted movie.... I never feedback a movie but this movie was something on a different level .... ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¥ðŸ‘
It was different from the show, but still really good. The movie felt more comedic than the show and the thing with the demon was kind of weird.
I may be new to this show. However the cinematography and art was amazing. The characters are enjoyable. I Love the music. The ending was unexpectedly tragic. I was hoping for more. A dream powered demon had more screen time than the third rank demon. Who knew that their were two villains in the movie. The fight sequences were top-notch.My only concern is that some characters talk too much. It Gives the movie some drag time. I only wish they could get on with it instead of whining or explaining a lot. Just act on it. Sometimes the characters overreact and it's annoying.Their scenes that have life-changing decisions and this movie gave me a great experience. Even though I am not a fan of the Demon Slayer. This movie inspired me to be a fan. I am happy for that.
I love it so much. I recommend you to watch it 100%.
A work of art with and incredible ending, don't miss this epic.
"Honestly I'm so happy to see this piece of art
It was amazing outstanding and fabulous moments
Can't wait to see the second series."
Not only the best Anime in years but also one og the best movie in all categories.
Best anime ever
Oh man oh man what a movie probably the best movie in whole world great storyline, great characters,great pacing, great action, great philosophies, great action 100/100ðŸŒŸ movie no flaws
"So first this is a wonderfull ""demon slayer""movie
Full of action and some scenes were so emotional
But well the plot wasn't that good most of the time a demon apear and they fight to death
It lacks a deep plot.a plot like spider family or something about tanjiro father
But almost no story even about 2 main demon we see
And zenitso was almost forgotteandIt was like tge creator was busy making breath taking scenes that they almost forgot about zenitso"
Mindblowingly Epic
This is my first ever review of the movie. I read reviews where the reviewers down-rated this movie and someone said that it might be best for teenagers. I am 35+ and I totally loved it. Visuals, story, music, pace, everything was perfectly inline with my taste and I can say that this is the best piece of art I have watched so far.
Reading the manga, I was truly excited for when this movie would be coming out. Though delayed, it was still magnificent. I watched this movie first in sub. It beautifully caught the arc from the manga. I laughed, cried, and held baited breath while watching the stunning animation display on the big screen. I loved the movie so much that I'll be watching it again dubbed. Truly worth the watch if you enjoyed season one and / or the manga.
This is my first review I am ever writing, I loved this movie so much I watched in twice in theaters. The animation was beautiful and pacing of the movie made it fly by. I really believe this movie will raise the bar for anime movies as most are just cash grabs but this one is actually canon fitting in between seasons 1 and 2. I like watching Season 1 but honestly I thought the movie was better and the deeper themes touched on will definitely linger with you once you leave the theatre.
The voice over with complete emotions and dedication the presentation of the story the music that will make one definitely emotional. Must watch for anime lovers.
My review might be short, but I think it's enough said.
"I watched the sub version. This is simply the best movie. Amazing animation, amazing voice acting, and an amazing story. It is perfect.There are not many movies that let you feel the raw emotions of the characters in this way, this is one of the best. It just goes to show that ""anime"" is not all about action scenes and cliche female characters.A must watch for anyone. Probably 16 or older to truly comprehend it."
There's no way you don't want to be a better person after watching this movie.
It's how we'll remember 2020... Probably the only positive thing in the past year.
Great movie that was on point
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL SET YOUR HEART ABLAZE!! If you have not watch the s1 too it doesnt matter. The only thing matter is emotion. If you have NOT WATCH AN ANIME BEFORE OR YOU THINK IT SOME KIND OF CHILDISH THING THAN OHH MAN YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING WITH YOUR LIFE, if you are a teenager, s** and this movie should'nt be miss before you die.
This film makes you enjoy every moment and merge with it. Animation, drawing and the power of events have made the film on another level than other films, this film deserves to be placed with the greatest films.
I read the manga and loved it and I hope I can watch it soon
A Must Watch!
"What an amazing movie, beautiful animation and the japanese VA stole the show. So much care has been taken to develop these characters. Hope they continue to do better in the next season. Lat 40 minutes is just pure beautiful art. Rengoku ""The Flame Hashira"" remember his name."
Has lived up to the hype for me. It's a great addition to the first season. The fight scenes are so beautifully choreographed and visually stunning. I already can't wait to see it again!
In simple words. I bet you will cry. This story is so heartwarming. Why they end like this. I can't wait to the next session of Demons salyer. Please Release it soon.
Soo Good Masterpiece. Amazing visuals. You must watch it. Kyojuro vs Akaza Fighting scence is amazingg.
"Have you ever wondered why most of the anime movies are not connected to the actual story arc. Well this movie is not a ""just a movie"" kinda one. It's tailored with great care to make it one as one of the best anime movies to watch n fall in love with. From the start the movie continues from where it was left in the first season and continues the infinite train journey of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke & Nezuko as they embark on this journey to fight the demon in the train. While u find this portion of the movie itself to be meaty,the movie jumps into an express concoction of action, dialogues, philosophy, master animation effects & BGM in the last 30 minutes to drill you down to the core of your emotions and make you think of it for the whole day. A must watch for all anime lovers...
Hail Kyoguro Rengoku!!!ðŸ”¥"
It starts off a little slow but when it picks up speed u r in for a ride one of the best movies i have ever seen and one of the best cinematic experiences i have ever had the climax of the story is THE BEST u will be shouting at the top of your lungs to support the characters (i felt just like when erwin and his squad were riding to certain death)
Amazing.but:
This movie will make you cry. I was in tears when I watched. The animation, voice actors, everything was top notch. I would give this movie 1000000 rating if I could.
"Getting goosebumps and waiting for further furios demons
Specially upper 6 kezukis."
The best anime movie I have ever seen. It was epic, touching, a piece of art!!!.Must watch for everyone not just anime fans. You will never regret watching this Masterpiece.
"The Epic fight scene I have ever Seen
I just can't wait to see the next part."
I was so lucky to get to see the movie in the cinema. Well well what an experience! Got goosebumps almost during the whole film. Soundtrack 10/10 . Action 10/10. Animation 10/10...Story 10/10 with a ending so devastating. I sadly got spoilers and I knew what was gonna happen....but it hit me really hard.I expect it being good. But not that good!What a masterpiece.
"Truly a masterpiece of animation, every scene is polished to the extreme, the combination of 3D and 2D is so exquisite you can't even tell where the one begins and the other ends.The ending is great, but painful as expected, it's amazing how they managed to make you feel so much for a character that has just been introduced.If I had to complain about something it'd be how little involvement Zenitsu had on the whole thing; to be fair it's usual for him to do his special move a couple times and fall on a second plane, but I feel like this time they could've approached it a bit different, specially considering how crucial Inosuke was for the plot.Can't wait for the 2nd season to start, it's going to be incredible!"
Absolutely amazing, from Sweden
Infinite.
No words totally blown up the animation is great .the music is great . The fight scenes are insane .
It's piece of art for sure. Both the anime and the movie ,, I feel bad cuz they ended I don't know when I can watch the next season.
I have watched the kimetsu no yaiba(Demon Slayer) season 1 and I just finished watching this movie. It is a masterpiece from the animation to music, action, little comedy, the story, and the beautiful ending. I cried at the end no joke. Must watch.
Its amazing
Sequel and immediate follow up to the ending of season 1. The visuals, soundtrack, humour, emotion and everything that comes with it is top notch. We get introduced to just how badass a hashira is. Can't wait for season 2.
Almost a week ago I went to see this with 2 of my friends, we all enjoyed it a lot! Both of them even cried at the ending (I don't cry a lot at movies lol)I'd definitely watch this again and I recommend it!
I made an IMDB account just to review this movie. I thought that season 1 of Demon Slayer was the most beautiful anime I've seen, and that it had some amazing fight scenes and emotional moments, along with funny moments. This movie took all of that and multiplied it. The animation at times looked life-like, yet not out of place, and the characters fit in perfectly. The fight scenes did not let down in this movie, it wasn't easily predictable, and it delivered for the full 2 hours. It is an hour after finishing the movie and walking home, and I am still shaking and out of breath from the whole experience.
Just one word, Amazing.
Top 10 of all time currently my fav.the best animation.
Worthy of the Hype
Animation top notch, light effects super story and fighting seens are op .. waiting for season 2 ..
"Animation 10/10
Plot 10/10
Enmu 5/10
Akaza 10/10
Character development 10/10
I only wish it was 2 hours longer!!"
I don't know why everyone is dissing it like get over yourself
My headline said it all! It exceeded my expectations, absolute masterpiece of a movie! Loved it from start to finish!
"This movie is unbelievable. I never expect so much from this film but this film gives more than you expected. Full of emotions, Action. Bgm. And Goosebumps scenes. OOFF....
If you love the anime. You should watch demon slayer. Its power is neither action nor story. REAL POWER IS UFOTABLE. They makes this film Best 2020 film of the year.AND YEAH IT CREATES HISTORY ON JAPANESE BOX OFFICE."
It's worth 10/10 absolutely. The animation is wonderful.
Man words cant explain how the movie felt to me, ive always loved the demon slayer series, this one was even fuckin cool. Idc wht others think of this movie , i just loved every second of it along with those stunning animations.
just like i expected it's incredible
"This is not just a movie..it is like a life lesson representation infront of your eyes!The animation, story everything was top notch..
Especially the character development.."
I just finished watching it. And it's a masterpiece the animation, audio, Character's evening is a master piece. Please watch the Demon slayer anime first, it's emotional as hell. Splendor indeed.
I Don't know what to say. When the film comes to an end my heart feels heavy it's like i am experiencing the movie in real life. It has every right to be called the best anime movie. Lisa also did a great job.
breathtaking.
One of the best anime movie I have ever seen, Full of great fights and drama, Definitely worth watching.
"Demon slayer is the best of the best...
I thought no one can produce better anime series than Attack on Titan. .
Demon slayer is now many miles ahead of AOT so far for me..."
Yes, almost - but the most complete one yet. The missing part - a romantic interest, but that wasn't in the series, so really you can't feel it (and it's not necessary)All the other stuff is there, action, comedy, suspense, frustration, despair, anger, sadness, love, anxiety, thrill, twist, surprises - you name it!!!You'll watch it again, but after a little while, you'll need some time to catch your breath and digest what you've seen!!
It was amazing best anime movie ive ever seen that actually pertains to the storyline and is cannon.
After I watched the first 26 episodes last summer, I was wondering how long should I wait for a sequel. And now I get it. And I really got more than I ever dreamed. This movie is astonishing in every way. The Dreams depict the character's feeling one by one, and I just got drowned in Renguko's and Tanjiro's dream. The first half was so good, That I thought this was actually the movie's peak. I was wrong. After I watched the second half, I was on the verge of tears. I can't really believe what I just watched. If you haven't watched it already, please just do it..
The fighting scene is awesome and in the end emotional scene, I am sure you will almost cry.
This was just absolutely amazing!! I barely seen the episodes, I saw a few with my son. But I watched this with him today and it was just excellent and exciting. The animation is a little goofy fer my liking but I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
I JUST FINISHED WATCHING IT ON YOUTUBE AND IT WAS PHONE RECOREDED AND THE MOVIE STILL LOOKED LIKE IT WAS HD IMAGINE IT IN A CINEMA. THE CHARACTERS ARE SO FUNNY AND CUTEE
Amazing
best movie i have seen in a while
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL VISUALLY, THE SOUNDTRACK IS PERFECT, THE HISTORY IS VERY GOOD AND THE FINAL BEYOND GETTING ME UNPREVINTED MADE ME VERY SAD ..... I WILL BE CRYING UNTIL NOW.
This movie is amazing in the animation and voice acting of the actors. This movie was worth every dollar and I should of bought tissues not popcorn.
Absolutely amazing
If you are not familiar with this Anime then My ADVISE IS that you MUST watch the 1st Season. Then you will appreciate this Survival Horror/Action Anime. The Movie starts off where the 1st season has ended. The movie straight away takes you to the journey and action begins. Though the premise is very simple that our Hero Tanjiro boards the train which has monsters on it. But given the length I was not sure how long the action sequences will be and the story part will be there or not. But the way story telling is done you get loads of actions and emotions and character development. The movie does not let you blink eyes for a second as the story and action happen on a pleasant pace and it keeps your interest going. The ending is not all happy go lucky but it does provides a glimpse of what is yet to come. And I am eagerly waiting for the next season to air. This movie is what keeps surprising me about anime and I recommend it for people who never had seen any anime or any movie based on it. If your mind is bored with this MUC & DC and want to watch stories with great characters and plot twists then this is one of those storytelling masterpiece.
It felt like a commentary on enlightenment and had concepts from eastern religions about consciousness and the nature of reality. Usually when anime series come out with movies it's lack luster, but this movie raised the bar.
""" UMAI "" DELICIOUS"
My favourite series great animation storytelling so much good and you will get emotional scene plus comedy. This anime give always a motivation and moral. Set your heart ablazeðŸ˜ƒðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
Anything that makes me cry like a baby will always get 10/10 in my books. I just wish that Netflix or Amazon will bring season 3 and 4 out quicker. Its so annoying and this Demon Slayer - is wonderful...
Went to the cinema to watch this, without knowing anything about it, and without having watched the series. Didn't know what to expect, but I got pulled in quickly, and was thoroughly entertained throughout. There is action, sad, and funny, quirky moments. After having watched this movie, I will definitely watch the series too. If you like Ghibli/Manga, you will probably like this... Give it a watch!
Being someone who has been around the anime scene for quite a while now I can honestly say that this might b one the most beautiful pieces I have seen in a long time. This has everything in it from great character development to one of the best action sequences in cinema history. Also I might add that the soundtrack for this movie was nothing short of a masterpiece. In this movie I laughed and cried harder than I have in a while all in all it was a great experience and I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in this franchise. God bless.
Kimetsu No Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-Hen, is a stunning piece of work that needs to be experienced by everyone who is interested in the show.The precise work of animation that is displayed is beyond perfect. Every frame of this film has so much effort put into it. And it shows.You get emotionally connected to these characters.And understanding their grief in wanting all of this to end, really makes you feel it. You don't feel like your just watching a TV show. You get immersed into this world the animators have made for us. And you feel like your right next to the characters, experiencing their pain and suffering.If you have an extra 2 hours to spare, give this movie your time. You will not regret it.
Seriously, one of the best movie ever made, perfectly balance, Humour, drama, fun. Perfect scenario the fighting scene are just brilliant! Must see !!
I absolutely loved this movie and it will always be in my heart. Incredible animation and characters, and the fight scenes were beyond gold. This movie was totally worth it. Though to be honest, its suprising to find so many fools in the comment section who think they can judge a movie despite not having watched the show? If you dont like the movie, but you havent watched the show, please tell me how can you put a review? Stop spreading hate.
The first thing I need to say the visual it's stunning oh my God it's another level. The battle between demon and demon slayer in train was a visual treat. This movie contains humour violence and emotion must watch.
The movie is definitely worth watching, it won't disappoint.
I thought it was my best animation in 2021, so with the fact that it plays both effects, sound color, which is pretty well made. It talks about characters that really eat people's heart up to the point where I want to walk into them. The pronunciation of emotion, the understanding of the characters, is well made. The story line is made to be easy to understand, people who aren't following them can understand. It doesn't cut off, it's also pretty good, it gives people a sense of the emotion they're trying to express, which is really good.
Tasty!
I Loved this Movie soooo much for any Demon Slayer fans this is a must seen after you Finish the First season only.
Heart touching _:
"Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-Hen is an film adaptation of anime that based on original ""Demon Slayer"" manga. It's about a duty of brave demon hunters which meet each other on the biggest train in Tokyo, where people disappears in mythic way. Tanjiro Kamado and Rengoku Kyojuro are the main characters of this amazing ark.The plot is exciting and full of secrets about main character abilities, family. Main idea is that Strong people should use their great power to help the weak people. Some moments are so emotional and inspiring! Tanjiro finds a lot of strong demons on this train, but Rengoku - the fire breath Hashira kills them so easily that everyone understand the power of the Hashira! At the middle of the film they gets inside of their minds. There was a scene where their clear and inflammatory souls show!I really loved the every moment, every second of this story. Animation is so good, that sometimes i held my breath! The combination of moving, funny and exciting moments are appropriate. I also amazed about the soundtrack of the fight, that makes it even more enjoyable to watch! This movie inspires me to become more kind and strong, after this film you will have a wish to help people no matter is the problem! And that's really true, that this film changed my outlook on life in good way! I can confidently say that this is a work of art!To sum up, if you're looking for the great action and adventure movie, this film is exactly for you! Dialogues of the characters make this film emotional and interesting to see. Character development is amazing, characters won't become boring for you! So grab the popcorn and ""Set your heart ablaze!""."
Amazing. You'll enjoy if you love the anime series.
Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train is a tight story with incredible action and stunning animation. It condensences all the emotion and energy of a full season into one film. Highly recommended for fans of the manga/anime.
For last 30 minutes part of the movie my tears were flowing as they have their own will it was difficult to even watch doesn't matter how much I try I can't stop shedding tears.
Everything in the movie makes it perfect, best movie I have ever watched. Waiting for season 2 of the series
NO SPOILERS. There was everything you could wish for. The action was jaw dropping. One specific fight scene was probably the best of the anime. THE HYPE IS REAL. The ending was EPIC. It's a film beloved by many including myself.
I am really happy to see this art work with all the effort of making it and glad to thank every single person that worked in this grate project.
Really good movie. Animation, special effects, music, action, story, intense fights.. All are great. ðŸ‘ The dubbing could have been better for English. Still, really good.
Been waiting for the anime adaptation of the manga for a while, and it didn't disappoint. The animation was amazing and the movie really made you feel attached to the Kyojuro. Felt like a long anime episode more than a movie.
If only they animated the demon-consumed-train better, it would have been a flawless flick. Apart from that this movie is wholesome. The trio of Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke does it's magic yet again and Nezuko, well she's just too cute and adorable but only untill she unleashes her fatal blood demon arts. Can't wait for the next season.
U should know this if u really a warm hearted person.ANYTHING we should watch must not needed to be judged. This should not be judged for knowledgeable or for style or making great actions ....sometimes things should be seen as how u feel upon watching and getting into it.So how I personally feel in this is actually this made me cry ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­ just like the main character get because....i realize that how I would react when the main character was me.So I think if u r reading this review then u should probably watch it and u should never judged things based on others thought.....may be he/she like something that u doesn't.
I see there are no mistakes or problems in this anime it's the best new-gen anime so far. The animation is perfect the drama is perfect I like everything about this anime.
Feel good and emotional.
Amazing animation and decent storyline however.....
Absolutely beautiful man like holy jesus chicken mc christ i loved it.
Definitely a must see, i have No complaints. Visually stunning great voice acting. The Japanese version is so amazing and emotional.
Watching this is genuinely spectacular not only in with the rest of the story but in isolation.The character of Rengoku is truly inspiring and his tutorship to Inosuke, Zenitsu and Tanjiro is simply fantastic.Villains are well based and have founded goals with a interesting power set.The animation is simply breathtaking especially the breathing styles.A must watch! (10/10)
Amazing storyline and fantastic anime
The story is great and just like the manga.The German synchro us great the iconic thommy Morgenstern (son Goku from Dragonball z) speaks the main char Rengoku and his enemy is spoken from the seto kaiba speaker. I watched the movie in Japanese , Englisch and German and all 3 watches worth it.
This movie along a with a really good story provides one the best animations I've ever seen, the characters and surroundings are so detailed that sometimes I got confused to whether I was looking at an animated movie. The story is also really good but, it felt as if both the villains were lacking something. All in all really good movie.
Being a anime man... I recommend everyone to watch this epic movie .... U will get everything at its peak .. including animation, effects, sadness, happiness and everything to make your day...
Movie was too good. As a manga reader, I knew the story, but I was amazed by the animation and storytelling. Ufotable is GOAT whenever you think about anime animation and KnY the movie also delivered too. I just can't wait for the next season.
Perfect
Tanjiro Kamado, along with Inosuke Hashibira, a boy raised by wild boars wearing a wild boar's head, and Zenitsu Agatsuma, a frightened boy who reveals his true power when he sleeps, board the infinite train on a new mission with the Flame Pillar, Kyojuro Rengoku, defeat a demon that has been torturing people and killing demon killers who oppose it. Ugh. 2020 Is Stupid! But I Love Anime,
Must Watch
As someone Who is just getting into watching all of the classic anime shows I have to say demon slayer and Jiu-Jitsu Kaisen are my favorite new anime's and i would go sofar and say it is a must watch master peace! I am looking forward to the next season!
Pretty good
It was great i got to watch it for totally FREE and idk what the bad reviews are for it was great and was worth watching.
"The animation and action scenes are gorgeous; the characters are compelling; the emotions are real; and the ending credits music is so damn beautiful."
I am glad I was able to see this movie. I thought it would just be one 2 hour long episode. I was wrong!Do I recommend watching the movie before Season 2? Yes, and it's worth it. The visuals are beautiful and it was a great watch! I had unfortunately heard the odd spoiler here and there but I still even got a little teary-eyed at the end. I can't wait to see what this series has to offer in the future!My only criticism is that it felt like Zenitsu didn't really do much in the film and he was just 'there'. However, I've heard it stays true to the manga and I love how they portrayed Rengoku! I'm definately watching again!
Best movie
"I'm mean..they got everything right
Ost, animation, story, emotions etc.Only the dialogue in some scenes and overexplanation made me reduce the score.I didn't like the original series, but if it continues like this, it would be really good."
BEST MIVIE OMGERNBEOWN SO GOOD. You should watch it.
The movie is beautiful with the graphics, it is awsome. One who liked the season 1 must definitely watch this master piece. 11/10. Must watch.
Op
The animation.The story.The characters.All perfect 10/10.
Nice movie but make sure to watch it after the tv show or go and watch a recap.
I am one of those who look at the manga to later see how the animation is, I expected a certain level coming from UFOTABLE and they complied, this movie has animation, sound, music, action, little Nezuko, a hero who made his audience thrill with his courage, Kimetsu No Yaiba is amazing.
mystical
A must watch for the fans of the series! Even who don't know much about Demon Slayer, it is still worth a watch.It is a fun-filled train ride filled with emotions, action, breathtaking art and stunning musical score. Don't miss this one! Quit reading the reviews and grab a ticket to board the Mugen Train!Caution: Parents, the film has violence, blood and scary body horror. Don't show this to your kids until they are 12 or 13.
All I can say is WOW! Such a masterpiece, fighting Scenes were giving me chills and the emotional part I just can't stop crying. First anime movie that I went back in theater to watch it again and it was so worth it!!!
This is a amazing movie, who a manga reader you know this movie about.
Masterpiece
First off, this is really a continuation from Season 1 of the anime. I do wonder if this works as a standalone movie. Having already watched Season 1, it wasn't a problem for me. Loved the movie, thoroughly enjoyed it. Plenty of action, and plot moves along at a brisk pace. Not too many draggy moments like some animes tend to have, telling grandfather stories from the moment they were a sperm until now. Definitely the apex fight had me at the edge of my seat. Can't wait for Season 2!
What can i say about this movie... the animation, oh my god the music, the story ,the feelings... soooo many feelings. Simply rating 10 is demeaning there is no rating for this amazing masterpiece.
Incredible animation, awesome fight scenes, and super emotionally impactful. I found myself tearing up two separate times, and full on cried at the end. It's awesome to see anime movies coming to a wider audience in the west.
As is always true with Demon slayer, solid storytelling, well put together characters, Brilliant action sequences, and an all-around enjoyable experience. My wife who doesn't get into anime even enjoyed it. Of course there's always one flaw, and this one is Too much monologue. I mean it's true of most anime, but seriously, we got the point 2 minutes ago. Still though, it didn't detract too much from the movie and it fits well in the grand story.
An anime you shouldn't miss. No regret.Speechless! Superb.
It was the best anime movie ever....... Everyone should watch it.
Perfect
This movie is bomd recommended
Sorry, not a fan of Demon Slayer, but everyone's been talking about it even before they announced this movie. Then this movie came out, everyone's just crazy about it. Can't really understand the hype about the series, I mean, visually it's good, the animation is fluid as hell, the story? Not so much, just your average shonen series. Then I saw how crazily people rate the movie after its release, so I decided to give it a change. Well, I might say I had a good time, it's worth your time if you're relaxing from some tedious, exhausting work, a great and emotional watch for the series' fans. Even for the non-fans, it's still visually compelling and awe-inducing. Go check it out...
I started to see Demon Slayer recently and after finishing season 1, I decided to watch the film before diving into the next seasons!Given the ratings I was expecting a masterpiece, I have to say the animation as always is at another level in the series and I feel its a core part of it, alongside the soundtrack it takes a show that could've been ordinary to the amazing level - and the movie is not different in this regard.The visuals are simply stunning, the fight scenes are amazing and engaging so it's for sure a must.With that being said I feel the movie suffers a bit from the same that the series does, the story and the plot is nothing new and slightly predictable.I feel the animation, the visuals, the soundtrack and the characters carry the show and the movie a little bit, as the story falls a bit short.Still it's a must see for anime fans, it's a masterwork in animation, great moments, great scenes and if you are watching the show I will give it a try since the movie adds a bit of a more dramatic feeling even if the episodes show the exact same plot.
Yes
It's been a good few years since I watched the first season of Demon Slayer but I still remember it vividly as if it were yesterday, I remember being so excited for this film and yet, I never watched it I missed its cinema run and thus never continued with the series, until now. Upon restarting my journey with Mugen Train, I was thrust back into the world of Demon Slayer without a second to spare and I am so happy to have finally watched it. Continuing the exceptional style and substance of storytelling I remember, one that sets my heart ablaze, in the best way imaginable, for amid the monster-slaying, there's a pointed celebration of how human weaknesses are our true strengths. The film manages to balance being outrageously funny, action-packed and emotionally devastating simultaneously, all rendered through first-rate animation that combines classic anime character design supplemented by outstanding CGI and swooping camera work. Slick and bright, with compelling world-building alongside an unabashedly earnest emotional core, the film fantastically builds upon a carefully constructed backstory for an unknown character that we soon trust and eventually cry over, Rengoku is undoubtedly the highlight of the entire film. Especially that final fight against Akaza which left my jaw lying somewhere on the floor. Combined with its incredible soundtrack, Mugen Train ends up delivering a Demon Slayer experience on a completely different scale and it's simply awesome. Emotional, intense, violent and, ultimately, beautiful. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some catching up to do...
Demon slayer the series was so good now I catch up with this movie this movie is so amazing and awesome and so beautiful animation when you watch such a beautiful a scene you bless yourself and thankful yourself you watch such a masterpiece movie movie stroy continue from where the s1 end. They started this movie in very best part they introduced the character and hasita and ended with very emotional scene I like the way the end and give best tribute to the character and stroy continue lest talk about some negative in negative I think train scene and some logical minor mistakes overall this movie is very amazing.
"I really love this movie, the only movie I watched where I was excited before watching it. It went by really fast. But, the movie itself just feels like watching another episode of demon slayer. That's good, but also bad, because, I want something different, not saying its unoriginal. Just, it needs a ""unique"" touch to it. Rather than it just being a episode stretched out into a movie, I want it to feel like a movie.Some of the duologue is kinda weird, not in a bad way. But its kind of funny.Overall really good movie, do recommend.TL;DR: feels like watching another episode of the series, and thats bad. But the movie is good though."
If you have watched the first season of demon slayer, it is a must watch movie!!
A simple but great movie with godly animation and music
Hilarious.
"Only run this far by last fighting and villains actings. Also by emotional drama of rengoku dying but worth it.Sorry for short review ðŸ˜¬
I wanna know which is better jjk0 or dsmg?KindlyPlease reply!"
Really enjoyable
If you love acton and fantisy then this movie is for you. I loved it. I would recomend watching the show, Demon Slayer first. I watched the whole show and it was amazing. If you liked the show then you will love the movie. There are other movies that they made to go along with the show. Which I think is awsome. This movie has action, anime, fighting and more. There were defenitly scenes where my jaw droped. I recomend this movie 100% to anyone. I think they choose good acters for this movie. If you don't think you will like this movie just please watch the trailer cause you might change your mind. Remeber everyone has there own opinion on things so if you watch it and don't like it that's ok.
"The highly anticipated anime feature ""Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Mugen Train"" masterfully blends the grandeur of the adored TV series with the big screen. The movie, which was directed by Haruo Sotozaki, centers on Tanjiro Kamado and his friends as they travel on the Mugen Train to battle evil powers. The film is a cinematic marvel that transports viewers to a realm of supernatural fights and intricate landscapes thanks to its amazing animation and fluid fight scenes. Beyond its breathtaking animation, the movie explores themes of resilience, friendship, and loss, offering both triumphant companionship and heartbreaking sadness. Both devoted followers of the Demon Slayer franchise and those who are new to it will find an absorbing experience thanks to the flawless pacing, which strikes the perfect mix between violent action and moving character development."
Set Your Heart Ablaze
Soooo yea I looooooovvveeeeeee taannnnjjjiiroooooooo.
a
"There is no way not to get emotionally involved with this movie. We already know the characters, and here we have the chance to see more screen time without interruptions, and literally know what Tanjiro's soul is like.Through its entire core, we can understand pain, feelings, and the character's context of suffering and overcoming.The presentation of Hashira of Fire is incredible and the outcome is very sad.I feel that when the film ends, it speaks to everyone, everyone who is helpless, everyone who is hopeless. Each one of us:
Regardless of what they say (...) lift your head. If you're feeling unmotivated, or feeling like you're not good enough, set your heart on fire. Dry the tears and move on. Remember that the flow of time never stops. It won't wait for you while you drown in sadness.It's just beautiful. All the sadness we followed, all the struggles and battles for us to feel this connection with the characters.An incredible film of intermediation of history. Very satisfied and extremely thrilled with the result."
"Best anime movie I have ever seen,
Second time I saw and it still pulled at my heartstrings enough that my wife was like are you being for real LOLAnother thing I like is that the movie is canon to the story, it is not just a money grab movie that doesn't have to do with the main story line .. you must watch for later seasons."
"Anime almost always follows a very specific formula and this movie is no different. It isn't as in-depth as the series and would require viewers to have seen it in order to understand the movie.But as a stand-alone, its alright.You can tell from the get-go who's gonna make it through so you may as well just sit back and enjoy the ride, the Mugen train ride. Its well animated but not as creative as some of the episodes of the series. The finale does drag on for a good 10 minutes longer than it needed. As soon as I saw the climactic scene, I knew the movie was not over yet and will have to drone on about life and yada-yada-yada (typical anime tropes)
but it was a find watch."
Ufotable is honestly on a roll with the hit Demon Slayer series. It's simply bloody fantastic but also has a lot of heart, as a lot of people will see in this movie, which introduces one of the other Hashiras of the Demon Slayer Corps.
Set Your Heart Ablaze..... Rengoku-sanAh finally back at the theater. It sure felt good. This is the Mugen train arc that was set up at the end of season 1 of Demon Slayer.I expected the same level of animation in the anime, and this movie delivered that aspect the best way it could. It was pleasure for my eyes to see the flame, water, and thunder breathing techniques on display. The action scenes were breathtaking and intense.My problem was that the plot was pretty simple, which made the movie felt too short. I wanted to learn more about the characters, especially Rengoku, and even the demons. The emotion did not hit as high as it could.Overall, the movie was still a blast. 8.5/10.
Nearly Perfect
If you liked the animation of the season 1 of demon slayer you will simply adore this film this is a true masterpiece with a captivating story and music that will make you cry , a must watch for any fan of the show .
10 is not enough, from Japan
Rengoku is awesome in this film, and you understand why everyone looks up to him.I just have to state the most obvious thing though, this animation is truly breathtaking, if you love the show you're going to love this movie.To be honest I just had a great time watching it, me and my friends all loved it, not to mention the fight scenes are impeccable.Definitely an A+
I read the manga so I knew what would happen but seeing it animated just brought another level of heartbreak to me. With the amazing animation and background music, I was engrossed in this movie. Also, the final fight scene between Rengoku and the Upper Rank Three demon was probably one of the best fight scenes I've watched so far. Granted, I haven't watched many fight scenes. Still, it was such a pleasure to watch.
If you have watched the first season of Demon Slayer. You will not be disappointed. If you only read manga, you will also not be disappointed. Feelz are real. Visuals 10, feelz 10, sound track 10, humour 10 and story line 10. So don't read other reviews to decide if you should watch it or not. Go and Watch it.
I was worried because the movie is in the train, and I was afraid it will become boring. After I finished the movie, i realize that I shouldn't worried about this thing from the start. Every scene in this movie is really well planed, if the action scene start getting too long they will change it into another scene so we will not get bored with the action (I mean the composition of action and te conversation is balance.)And then the effects, both 3D and 2D. It's P E R F E C T. Even though we only have 2 hours to know Rengoku character, but the feeling, the emotion still really hit me. Like I cry a river in the cinemaðŸ˜¬It's really recommended! But please remind this in your mind that you need to watch the season 1 before you watch this movie.
"Had no idea what I was walking into, that's as frank as I can make it. Out of nowhere my kid has a love for Demon Slayer and here I am along for the ride. But she's seen the show and I had no context. Here we have a bunch of people on a train, one of them really excited about his bento box (""Umai! ... Umai!""), another wearing a boar's head, now everyone's asleep and pretty soon the fighting begins . . .That said . . .It is a gorgeous film. The battle scenes are exciting, the animation is superb, and the high quality bears out (Tanjiro's water effects are crazy).Purely on a visual level, I enjoyed this film. I have no doubt that any self-respecting anime fan is scoffing at my ignorance, but it is what it is. Mugen Train is easy on the eyes."
An amazing thrill ride full of comedy, dark and emotional moments that will leave you begging for more. If you liked the Demon Slayer anime, you are sure to love this movie.
I wont say the best but its really good, full of every anime recipe. This is my first time watching anime movie in cinema its worth it. Feel like gonna watch again!
"Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is a movie that was looked forward to universally with as much hype as possible. And when it eventually did come out, the reviews were great and so was its box office performance. And ever since, this movie has been a pretty big deal amongst the anime community.I finally was able to watch it, and I guess I'm a little underwhelmed by the whole thing. My reaction to this movie was very similar to how I felt about the series, and I think the same can be said of everyone. The series, in my opinion, is a decently enjoyable B-Tier anime with 1 exceptionally phenomenal episode. But that's just my take on it and I'm aware I'm in the minority here, because the amount of love this series has garnered is almost unbelievably massive and universal. So what Mugen Train caters to is exactly that demographic of fans (as so it should), meaning that for someone like me who found very little to go crazy about in the series, would find very little to go crazy about in this movie. But if you're one of those who loved the series for its goofiness and style, then this movie is in every way a treat.I don't think Mugen Train was a bad movie in any way. It was decently enjoyable and had its little moments. The plot is pretty straight forward but makes very little sense if you even stop to think about it. The progress was lazily convenient and the stakes never felt real until at the very end of the movie. The humor was pretty goofy and the characters were as over-the-top as they were in the series... Enjoyable, still The animation was pretty good and consistent throughout; especially the action scenes that were choreographed as well as they were in the series. The colors, the visuals, the music... they're all pretty great and add to the visually pleasing appeal of the movie.In conclusion, this movie doesn't add anything to the medium in any meaningful way, but it stays true to its style and convention as that is what people love most about the Demon Slayer universe. If you loved the series, you'll love this movie... Go for it!"
This movie takes of where season one of the series stops and it is just that, 2 episodes stitched together. So if you didn't see the series, you need at least watch a recap before watching this. Although I've seen a lot of anime movies and I know Japanese animation has a different approach than western animation, I was very underwhelmed by this one and not moved at all.Only watch this movie when you love the series.
Unbelievable out of the box
Yeah the succes of this movie is no secret by this point! It started a trend where other studios also made movies that tied into the shows, such as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, One piece Red and the upcoming Haikyuu final part 1 and 2!The movie is guarenteed to blow you away og shock you in one way or another! The story is simple, but effective! It never feels like it slows down, and the almost 2hr runtime will go by fast! By the time the movie ends you will have cried your eyes out! So many emotions in this movie! The animation is also INCREDIBLE!! UNREAL AT TIMES!! Set the bar for the amazing fights in season 2! The characters are also likeable and all get their moment to shine! Soundtrack is also incredible, especially Akaza and Rengoku theme!Overall a fun and emotional train-ride i would highly recommend!
Having seen the anime I loved this movie. Outstanding animation and likable characters (tanjiro, zenitsu, inosuke).(Saw in japanese with english subtitles)Really funny and emotionally investing scenes with awesome looking fight scenes.
Just wow!!!
A true delight for the demon slayer fans, starts slow but picks up the pace brilliantly after the interval.
Worth watching in the cinemas! The animation and the story arc is excellent!
"I'm so sorry everyone...but I didn't like it; that's a shame 'cuz the Anime is actually pretty good (8/10). My huge apologies."
First half of the film was pretty cheesy, slow and I found uninteresting compared to how amazing the show really is.The last 20-30 minutes of this movie really was the anchor as it was a spectacular fight scene with incredible animation that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Made it worth the watch and hopefully they figure it out in the next film where the the whole story will be interesting to watch.
Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train (2020) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on Hulu. A serial killer demon(s) has made the news as they target victims on trains. Flame Pillar, Kyojuro Rengoku,is looking to destroy the demon. He is aided by our heroes from the Demon Slayer series.This movie is directed by Haruo Sotozaki (Cowboy Beebop: The Movie) and contains the voices of Hiro Shimono (Attack on Titan), Natsuki Hanae (Dragon Ball Z), Satoshi Hino (Naruto) and Katsuyuki Konishi (Pokemon: The Movie).The animation in this is outstanding, especially the attack scenes. I adored the depiction of the demons and the weapons attacks and enhancements were great. The villains were good and creative and there's several scenes in doubt for our heroes. The final fight is unbelievably good.Overall this was a well done movie that did the series proud. I would strongly recommend this and score it a 8.5/10.
Good. But the hype is totally meaningless. One of the most overrated animated movies the world has ever seen on planet earth.
Nice animations, but very corny and clichŽ
