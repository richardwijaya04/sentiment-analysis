# üìä Big Data Analytics for Business: Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews

## üìù Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from IMDB movie reviews scraped from the web. Utilizing various machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods, we classify user reviews into Positive, Neutral, or Negative categories. The goal is to derive insights into user sentiment towards a particular film and compare the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression models for sentiment classification.

## üìå Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Gather IMDB movie review data through web scraping.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess textual data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Assign sentiment labels using a lexicon-based approach (VADER Sentiment Analyzer).
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate SVM and Logistic Regression models.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of the two models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- **Visualization**: Provide visual insights through heatmaps and bar plots to illustrate model performance and sentiment distribution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for training SVM and Logistic Regression models.
- **NLTK (VADER)**: Lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool for labeling data.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For creating insightful visualizations of model performance.
